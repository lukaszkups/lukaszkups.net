> tl;dr It’s the way of making things, using not exactly latest (hyped) tools, but those which actually works best for You.

So I can call myself a boring stack javascript developer - which means that I can ship clean, maintanable code that implements Your business goals, but I don’t have in my CV the shiny, latest frameworks which Your company is looking for (only because other companies also do it).

Challenge of the Year 2017 - find a company that is looking for boring stack javascript developer.

Seriously, I dare You.

Best,
