Today I've learnt that Microsoft has been working on something called *Adaptive Controller* which aims specifically into disabled people who wants to play games in most comfortable way.

This product is a part of the Microsoft's [Empowering](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/empowering/) campaign.

## Internet is a really weird place

I've found mixed reactions about this video. Most people accuses Microsoft of using topic of disability for their own PR campaigns.

## Duh, it's probably not a secret that this might be just a PR move, but it's at least an appropriate one

In my opinion, this is awesome that company like Microsoft works on such devices. This whole campaign is just likely a PR move, but in a best of its form. If companies wants to play on our feelings, then go on - as long as it goes with something good to other people.

## But there's only one 'but'

The only disadvantage I've noticed about this device is its price. I understand that games are not a first-aid product, but the pricing of optional peripherals is nuts. I could even took the price of the main controller itself (99.99$ at the time of writing this article) as understandable, even if it's a bit pricey e.g. as for the average earnings in Poland, but...

65 freaking dollars for a single button? Something is definitely not right here. I really want to believe that behind this number is space-class quality and hard work of dozens engineers but... it definitely can be solved with lower price. I wonder how much does it cost to complete a full set of controllers (base + addons) for moderately disabled person - I suppose that the final cost will be near the price of the Xbox console itself - that's a big no-no, dear Microsoft.

## But anyway, it's a very good idea

Despite the overpriced side of this product, it's great that someone thinks about people with disabilites. I wonder what would happen if other big players of the gaming market has created their own versions for such devices. (I'm watching on you Sony, but at the same time I think that Nintendo is the one that would figure out most clever solution, that would not require to break the bank to afford for).

To sum this up: big applause for you Microsoft for that you're trying to help people which are often forgotten or ommited by the industry.

Thank you.
