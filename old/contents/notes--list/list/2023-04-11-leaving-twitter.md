> &tldr; I can't stand the current state of twitter that is happening recently. My timeline is no longer showing me what I want to and it feels like I don't have any control about it. So I've decided to leave twitter and move to [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@lukaszkups). I hope that twitter will reborn one day.

# My first professional social media account

It was around 2009, during my first apprenticeship I've been introduced to the magical world of programmers: hackatons, programming conferences, [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website and most importantly - twitter.

I remember initial excitement when I've discovered that I can see what my programming idols are doing right now and how easy I can interact with them. I literally fell in love with this platform. 

I can say that I've been using it almost on daily basis (thank you, [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)) for all this years (plus I've restarted my presence (account) there somewhere ~2017 because of reasons that even I'm not sure anymore ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

During that time I've met all kind of people - from superbly friendly to total douchebags - but thanks to constant moderation of my twitter feed/lists/circles I was spending my time there in totally healthy manner, learning mostly about topics I was interested in (programming, entrepreneurship, Meteor.js and/or Vue.js frameworks and JavaScript ecosystem in general).

Most recently I've become interested into [game development](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1935130/Terry_Poorflyer/) and twitter has become my main source of news, guides and inspiration for that topic. I didn't realize that it's not gonna be my main source of headache that prevents me from switching to another platform during my twitter exodus (but I'm gonna explain that in a moment).

# Wind of change

At April 14, 2022 [Elon Musk has bought the twitter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acquisition_of_Twitter_by_Elon_Musk). Internet didn't blow up as some of people was expecting it, but it was a first step of the incoming changes that were inevitable from that point.

To be honest, I didn't care that much, at least in the beginning. I do find it bizzare though, when I've heard about gigantic layoffs in the company itself, especially that it was another big layoff that has happened in a very short amount of time - I've felt bad for the people that had to look for another job while there are already many other people doing that as well.

Time passed, and so the new ideas appeared on how Elon Musk sees the future of the twitter: limiting visibility/discoverability, forcing user to pay for Twitter Blue plan, you name it.

I've even tried Twitter Blue for one month. And to be honest, I do feel that discoverability of my posts were even much worse than without it (so I've already canceled it). Add to that weird UX/UI of publishing/editing tweet buttons didn't help at all either üôÑ

# Leaving self 


# Summary

14 years is A LOT. And you can say that you've become a part of the community that you've belonged for so long time - and so do I feel that way!
