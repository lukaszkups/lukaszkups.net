## Technology

This was a pretty busy week. This time I haven't managed to work much on [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli) desktop app because of many family-health-related tasks in my free time. I've mostly browsed existing CLI/Webpack-based Electron.js configuration because I was looking for one particular solution I needed for my project.

## Life

Still managing to stick to my 7-16 work plan. 👍

I've watched [What happened to Monday](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1536537/) on Netflix. I can recommend to anyone who wants an interesting sci-fi/action film story with couple unexpected plot twists. 🎥

Favorite songs: [Nhato - Gekka](https://open.spotify.com/track/6BDUdwOnjVTGWJbsbOcm9V) and [The Chainsmokers & Coldplay - Something like this](https://open.spotify.com/track/6RUKPb4LETWmmr3iAEQktW) 🎧

## Summary

It was a bit exhausting week. I had to run some errands after work on couple days - gosh I'm so thankful that I can avoid commuting in rush hours over the city on daily basis because I work 100% remotely. It's so less stressful & time savvy. 💪 🔥 🚗

Remote work FTW! 🙌
