> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I was pretty busy with random paperwork-related errands so I didn't spend much time on any tech/side-project programming stuff.

Out of nowhere I have got an idea for new side-project - but setting it back for now until I finish working on [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli).

I have also tried out a bit programming in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - at the moment all I can say that I really do prefer working with raw JavaScript ðŸ˜† - but maybe at some point in the future I'll change my mind.

## Life

I've finally watched [The Joker](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7286456/) and gosh, this movie would be still great even if it wasn't set in DC (or any hero-related) universe ðŸŽ¥

I've also just seen [The Fast & Furious 9 movie trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GuQuWjNUhwQ&feature=youtu.be) and hmmn.. what has been seen cannot be unseen - I remember times, when these movies were about street racing though ðŸ™„

Favorite songs: [Diplo feat. M0 - Get it Right](https://open.spotify.com/track/3mehbiGKy2x5Lz1nRmZ4Vj?si=3VvaQWDpST-0eQzhlK3M_Q) and [Jack Ãœ feat. Kai - Mind](https://open.spotify.com/track/6ZpR2XFuQJSHAQwg9495KZ?si=79I4IsZaTWqFC3p4mmtdug) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

I don't really like weeks like this - I do prefer working with code than papers ðŸ˜€
