> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

During this week I was browsing documentation of the [ant design for vue](https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/) - especially the concept behind [form component](https://www.antdv.com/components/form/).

Besides that, I've started working on building helper library of [writteli](https://github.com/writteli) - building it from scratch with fresh approach, to make it more extensible and modular.

## Life

My first week at [new workplace](https://www.hicxsolutions.com/) went pretty smooth - very excited about things that I'm going to work on ðŸ˜Ž ðŸ’ª ðŸ”¥

I have also managed to met with my group of friends since my teenage years (we've managed to met in full squad after ~11years!). Good times.

And it's celebration time ðŸŽ‰ My twitter followers counter has reached 100 people this week! I wonder how many bots are out there ðŸ˜†

Favorite songs: [Jack Ãœ - TO Ãœ](https://open.spotify.com/track/3UgSQu6WwrXfKKDq019IHE?si=KihYL_CbRxmxTgPHjgXD2A) & [Dakota Star - It's all about you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jI_NpFV70Y) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Still being busy! ðŸšŒ ðŸ˜… As a proof of this let it be the fact that I published this article on Sunday (as always) but at 23:28 ðŸ˜….
