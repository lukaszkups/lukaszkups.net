Since the beginning of this year I've made couple decisions that has lead me to meet my old <strike>friends</strike> tools.

Couple months ago I've switched operating system on my private laptop from ElementaryOS (linux) to Windows 10. Now I've took an advantage of couple moments of free time so I've moved my website from static site generator to Wordpress.

I feel a bit weird - I've never thought that I'll use such tools again for my personal needs.

Life likes to surprise us, apparently.
