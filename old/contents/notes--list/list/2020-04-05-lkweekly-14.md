> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I was so busy with various errands that I couldn't find any spare time to continue working on my side projects. But I've started writing a new article instead - will be published in the upcoming week.

## Life

While my kid is still playing [LEGO Marvel Avengers](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lego-marvels-avengers-ps4/) in free roam mode I continue playing magical [Journey](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/journey-ps4/) game (I'm in love ‚ù§Ô∏è) and also just started today [Starlink: Battle for Atlas](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/starlink-battle-for-atlas-ps4/) üéÆ.

Favorite songs are literally the same as last week: [Cloud 9+ - Sasquatch](https://open.spotify.com/track/3D7fCiY3zy2ay9l6KnqIIg?si=SgkT0f3cRCC2STfRQqc-TQ), [Cloud 9+ - When We Were Young](https://open.spotify.com/track/75QtXqJNXaEaB8JR38OUfr?si=qXmAPzRqRDqRD6BrIOTHZQ) & [Dakota Star - It's all about you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jI_NpFV70Y) üéß

## Summary

I was struggling with writing this [lkweekly](/notes/?category=lkweekly) note again - mostly due to lack of any tech progression during this week, but in the end that's the meaning behind this note serie - to distinguish one week from another.
