> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Continuing work on [Lem](http://lem.pub) - already created very first draft on creating new/opening existing one Lem project (using [NeDB](https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb) this time to handle data & [Buefy](https://buefy.org/) for the UI). Not really had much time to spend on it since I'm working long hours right now on my full-time job.

## Life

I'm so overworked right now that it's hard to mention anything other than just working from the early morning until the very late night. I've only managed to see an episode or two of [The Crown](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/) serie with my wifey in free time. ðŸ“º

No favorite songs this week. ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Waiting for the Christmas break already soo much ðŸ›Œ
