# My page is blooming

When I took a look on my window and I've seen typical Polish autumn there, I've decided to change my branding colors a little bit (maybe until summer come back here 🌻🌅🌄🌞) - at least this is the (easiest) way to upbeat my Internet presence around here for now..🤔

Old color: <span style="display:inline-block; width: 1em; height:1em; background: #FFA500;"></span> `#FFA500`

New color: <span style="display:inline-block; width: 1em; height:1em; background: #30de0b;"></span> `#30DE0B`


# it's not only about the colors

Besides rebranding I've quickly updated my static site generator stack (which stuck at Node v13 with some weird npm scripts, written in some early CommonJS format 🤨 ) - now it runs on latest Node + Vite + TypeScript.

Don't get me wrong, it was really fast copy-paste procedure with syntax adjustments (most of types are set to ~~good~~ old `:any` values 😅).

BUT (!) I've promised myself that I'm gonna modernize whole codebase as well in near future 🤞🙂.

What do you think about new color? I hope it's gonna brighten you all the foggy autumn (& winter!) days that are coming 🙌

Best,
