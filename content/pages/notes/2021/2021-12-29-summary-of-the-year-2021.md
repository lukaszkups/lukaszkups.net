## In 2021, I've learnt that I'm bad in "work-life balance" game

By the end of 2020 year, I've accepted an offer to work in [Mercedes-Benz.io](https://www.mercedes-benz.io/) - first as a sole front-end developer to develop an UI of internal product, and then I've been delegated to help with another product that is being developed by MB.io.

The transition to a new workplace was very smooth, even though I've agreed with my [previous team](https://www.hicx.com/) to help them in free time when I will be able to.

So the first half of the year was like a marathon. I had to learn TypeScript that is being widely used at [MB.io](https://www.mercedes-benz.io/), develop new product in given amount of time* and try to help my folks from my previous project as much as I can.

\*budget

So after 6 months, there was a first month that I was unable to do anything for my previous team. I've decided to split up at that point as it was very stressful for me and I was feeling guilty that I can't spend more time on work for them. I do really appreciate the trust that they've put in me and their willingness to cooperate with me on part-time basis. 💛

## Lessons learned

This year I've finally used to work with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) 🙌 🔥

(I won't mention that I've **learned it**, as still I find some quirks from time to time that I need to google for to make it work with [Vue 2](https://vuejs.org)).

Regarding my side projects, because of tons web-related work I've been into making simple, proof-of-concept games:

- [Tanki](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/tanki) - a top-down 2D PvE shooter

- [Super Zero Adventures Platformer demo](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/super-zero-adventures-platformer) - a 2D platform game PoC

- [Super Zero Adventures Exploration demo](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/super-zero-adventures) - a Zelda-like single level game PoC

I've also created one PoC using Vue, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS - [A Creepy Labirynth](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/creeppy-labirynth) (I was really inspired at the time by the approach of mimicking 3D/FPP perspective on 2D scene by [Backspace Bouken](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097170/Backspace_Bouken/) devs).

As you might notice, there was 2 games that shares *Super Zero Adventures* title - those were created as PoCs for a bigger, full game that I've wanted to develop one time. At the moment of writing this post I've stopped the development of it, but I've managed to create 3 levels with some cutscenes in between them.

You can see some of the available gameplay above (it was recorded when I had only intro, tutorial level and cutscene between 1st and 2nd levels).

## COVID-19 situation

In November, I've got COVID 🤒. Fortunately, I've vaccinated myself twice, so I've gone through it in a pretty decent manner (I could compare it to a really bad flu, but I've totally lost my taste for 3 days). Fortunately everything is alright now (as I didn't have to visit hospital was a really good news).

## Personal growth stats

142 contributions (422 less than in 2020) - that's the amount of commits I've made solely to my own projects (but not counting those from my full-time job and the efforts I've made into gamedev (as those are not git-based but are being saved on personal cloud and loaded into [Construct 3](https://www.construct.net/en) web-based editor)).

My [StackOverflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1004946/lukaszkups) still lives its own life and earned 630 points this year (5175 in total).

This website has been seen by ~30k unique visitors in total (so again, an +6k growth in comparison to the last year). It's a really nice number, as this year I was really lacking of publishing anything new here (and last year I had an [lkweekly](/notes/?category=lkweekly) project!). I assume that my acivity on social media has helped me with this (I've been putting screenshots/videos of my games there).

## Social media

- twitter: ([@lukaszkups](https://twitter.com/lukaszkups)): +33 new followers (139 in total)

- instagram ([@lukasz_kups](https://instagram.com/lukasz_kups)): same as last year, 117 in total

## Entertainment

**Books:**

I was lazy this year and I won't hide it - I've ready only 2 books this year (Alien 1 and its sequel). I also read now way less online articles, as I've started relying more on couple weekly mailings instead (about programming / gamedev / webdev / front-end / Node.js / security).

I also continue my classic Transformers G1 comic book series 😁 (I'm at 70th issue now 😅).

**Movies:**

Referring to the last year note: I've seen *Ad Astra* (it was pretty nice, but I was expecting something else a little bit 🙂).

[Stephanie (2017)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3829378/) - seen it by accident, but it's a pretty decent horror movie (shame that it had so little budget for CGI, but still, it's  movie).

[The Visit (2015)](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3567288/) - another cool horror, has some creepy moments, also has a nice plot-twist in the end.

[The Expanse](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/) - I'm at 4th season right now - gosh, it's really great sci-fi serie!

[The Boys](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_t_1) - this serie rocks! Imagine R-rated Avengers with more realistic, bittersweet life problems - can't wait for new season!

**Games:**

[Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn/) - after beating it on PS4, I'm playing it now on PC. Must admit, it's way easier to fight with mecha-dinosaurs with mouse control 💪 🏹 🦎 🔥

[A Plague Tale: Innocence](https://store.steampowered.com/app/752590/A_Plague_Tale_Innocence/) - randomly started playing it out of curiosity, but I've got hooked into the main story to be honest 🐁

[Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/414340/) - one of the best games I've played in 2021 (as I've created a [dedicated article about it](/notes/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-game-review/)).

[Deus Ex: Mankind Divided](https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/337000/) - one day, I'm gonna finish this game (started 3 times already)..

Honorable Mentions:

[Forza Horizon 5](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-5) - while I don't really play it regularly (in contrast to my son 😁) I think this is one of the most astonishing title in terms of graphics in 2021.

[Moving out](https://www.xbox.com/pl-PL/games/store/moving-out/9NXPBSMHPLTV) - this game is soo cool to play with someone (e.g. your kid 😁) - tons of laughts & fun!

## Small wins

There was a couple family/personal related ones, which I'm gonna keep for myself 😁

Besides those above, I'm really happy that I'm finally working full-time with TypeScript 💪 🔥 (as I couldn't/didn't want to/had-many-more-ideas/excuses for other things to do than force myself to learn it properly earlier 😅)

## Small failures

I dunno to be honest... Not working enough on my side-projects maybe? But I've spent that time on my reset/leisure time so I was able to function somehow between one 12+ hours-long day of work (so I REGRET NOTHING in that case haha 😆)

## Plans for the 2022

- Work again on [Tavuelo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo) package (bump dependencies, add missing functionalities etc.)

- Start working again on Lem app (?)

- Go back to regular workouts - I'm basically at the same place as in the beginning of 2021 (or maybe even worse, as I've stopped working out on regular basis since the last couple months)

- Finish at least 1 indie game title properly

- Spend more/More/MORE/MORE! time with my family 💑

## Summary of the summary

So wrapping things up, it wasn't a really bad year. But it also wasn't super-dooper-great one. It was **just** decent.

I wish you, and myself a waaay better one, 2022! Happy New Year! 🎉
