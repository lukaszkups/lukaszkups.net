> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

During this week I've been working on my simple, pure *for-fun* project - a turn based strategy game, inspired by another game, [Into the breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Breach). I've decided to develop it in the way I enjoy (Vue.js-powered, DOM-based) and not the most appropriate one (using canvas anyone?).

I've also worked a bit on my small video project (details below 👇) - I've learned about new (at least for me) video editing software - [Movavi Video Editor Plus](https://www.movavi.com/video-editor-plus). It's a great and waaay cheaper alternative for even such advanced tools like [Premiere Pro](https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) from Adobe - even interface is very similar so if you're like me, who used Premiere Pro in the past, maybe it's worth checking this app as an alternative? 🤔

Be aware though, that on the [Movavi](https://www.movavi.com/) company website you have various apps available - just go with their Video Editor Plus app 😉

## Life

Some of you might already know, that I've won an [Oppo Reno 3](https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphone-reno3-pro/) smartphone in an online contest 😊🍾🎆

The contest was organized by Polish tech portal, [SpidersWeb](https://spidersweb.pl) and Oppo - all I had to do was to send in a comment my idea how I would like to review Oppo Reno 3 smartphone 🤔 I've got an idea that I would first create a crazy introduction, inspired by [Vytautas water commercial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nITLob098W8), and then I would do the review itself inside the Renault car (in Polish language, *Reno* and *Renault* sounds exactly the same so it's a bit of catchy wordplay 😉).

I've received the phone last week, and during the weekend I was working on that review (that was the contest rule - if you won, you have to create such review) - and that's also the reason why this week's [lkweekly](https://lukaszkups.net/notes/?category=lkweekly) is a bit delayed (sorry! 🙏)

This was also a huge lesson for me - I've never imagined how difficult is to create a review video - but maybe one day I'll create more video content instead of text articles? 🤔 We'll see 😎

## Summary

Once I'll receive green light from the SpidersWeb's redaction, I'll share the link with my review here 😉
