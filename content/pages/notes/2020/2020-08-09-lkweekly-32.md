> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Finally making some progress with my Lem desktop app (previously known as Writteli). As I've mentioned last week, I've decided to stay with [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/).

This week I've managed to make Node.js libraries working inside Vue.js app that is wrapped in NW's window (yeah, might sound crazy a bit, but I really enjoy how it all turned out - it feels refreshing to solve problems in hacky way as an opposite a bit to daily programming tasks (& solutions) that I encounter at full-time job).

I've managed to migrate codebase from one of my previous playgrounds into my now-officialy-ongoing repositories.

So at the moment I'm able to select folder which I want to create new LEM project (working on validation to check if it contains already created one) & added WYSIWYG editor (it's called [TipTap](https://tiptap.scrumpy.io/) - I do really enjoyed working with it in the past)

## Life

I think I need to spend more time away from the keyboard - as at the moment it's like 90% of the day ðŸ˜®

I've also started playing [Phantasy Star Online 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1056640/Phantasy_Star_Online_2/) a bit - I was a big fan of the 1st edition of it (despite the fact I've played it offline, on PC (it was most popular on GameCube/Dreamcast)) so that was great news for me.

Favorite songs: [Tiffany - I Think We're Alone Now](https://open.spotify.com/track/4uvjOKsp7mSjrDhWdkLPBY?si=4eFE8e3bSA2aPwM9ZrSEZg) & [Termite & PsoGnar - Senses Overload](https://open.spotify.com/track/5uvJFkaN571MYOyNODQtze?si=R17ua9thTvulEUjy8mwrJg) ðŸŽ§
