> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Basically no tech related stuff - there was a Christmas this week so I was focused on quality family time and no hacking side-projects.

## Life

Because of COVID-19, this year we've spent whole Christmas holidays at our home.

No favorite songs this week as I've listened lots of Chrismas carols to boost the X-mas mood â›„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…

## Summary

I hope you all had a great & safe Christmas time, spent with your loved ones ðŸ¤— I would like to wish you a Happy New Year 2021 - hope it will be waaay better than this one!

PS. This is the last time I'm writing [lkweekly](/notes/?category=lkweekly) - I'm working right now on a big, summary note that will wrap up my whole lkweekly project - to be released early 2021 - stay tuned! ðŸ˜Ž
