> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

It was a pretty busy week. I'm still working hard on releasing version 1.0 of [Tavuelo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo) in this century 😂 (don't laugh, still managed to release 0.10.1 💪). At the same time I'm working on some new other articles on the blog.

## Life

Busy, busy, buzzy bzzz 🐝

Nothing very spectacular, finding last items in [Lego Worlds](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lego-worlds-ps4/) with my kiddo in my spare time 🎮 😎

Favorite songs: [Nine Thou - Grant Mohrman Superstars Remix](https://open.spotify.com/track/5yT7P2ZY99C373vtcYWVHx) 🎧

## Summary

I've almost forgot about this week note - I was focused on writing other stuff so much that I haven't realized is Sunday already. To be honest, this #lkweekly issue release was totally not on my way - I've started to consider other release cycle but that's the info for another time.
