## Technology

Another busy week!

I've managed to work further on [Lem](https://lem.pub) app - I've somewhat finished first draft of my article editor component, so I can now create/edit them easily. Now I'm working on fetching its contents into the article list in an efficient way, so the details as Title/published date/tags/categories will be fetched asynchronously as list page updates. And this feature required adding new event to my [Tavuelo](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) package which I use in this app! After a couple minutes of tweaking I've developed it & released as a new version - 0.12.11 - which release notes you can [read here](/notes/tavuelo-01211-release-notes/).

I must admit that [dogfooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) the stuff that I've created is awesome - I can battle test it properly in various scenarios and when I see some features missing - I can just add them! ðŸ˜Ž

## Life

> Work, work, work & some family time in between.

I think I'll just quote this sentence from the last week (and will continue doing that for upcoming weeks as well).

Besides that, I've got interested into [Construct 3](https://www.construct.net/en) - mostly because of [Monkey With Guns devlogs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DED6dvUfwCs&list=PL4GTIWB4rPQygBJxy6QX3-UVAEmNZPALl) - really interesting stuff!

I've tried couple game engines in the past (last one was [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)) but never really made anything more than following some baby step tutorials - maybe this time I've manage to dive deeper into gamedev ? Who knows ðŸ˜Š

Don't have really any favorite songs this week - I've just played anything in the background as a white noise this time ðŸŽ¶

## Summary

Work, work, work.
