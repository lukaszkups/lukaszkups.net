> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Last week I've got an idea to change main prerequisites regarding [Lem](http://lem.pub) project. Unfortunately it will extend development phase but in the end Lem become a way more versatile tool (so not only for website/blog management, but any content you're gonna need/want).

I've also released a [0.12.12 version](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo) of [Tavuelo package](/notes/?category=tavuelo). Since that update contained only version bump of couple dependencies that was fixing its known vulnerabilities I've decided to not create a dedicated note with release notes - I've just put an information in a tweet from [Tavuelo official account](https://twitter.com/tavuelo/status/1310152382890868737) 😎.

## Life

Comparing to previous week, this one was waaay better - managed to limit overtime hours a bit and spend more time on side projects.

And it was snowing for the very first time! ⛄

Thanks to remote work, I did a short break in the middle of the day and took my kids to sleds 😃 (for the younger one, it was her first time on snow ever 🙌)

Besides that, still watching [The Crown](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/) serie & playing my game, [BOINK!](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink) 😉

Favorite song: [Timeflies: Beast](https://open.spotify.com/track/7vhSZcOyPl7rciJvle0oOW?si=U-eaPAX0TpmR1CJiyAX22A) 🎧

## Summary

Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow ❄
