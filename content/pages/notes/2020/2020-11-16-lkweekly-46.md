> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Oops, I did it again

Due to my lack of planning ahead this week's lkweekly has been delayed by 1 day (Your Honor, I have literally nothing for my defense ðŸ™Œ).

## Technology

Going further with my past notes, I haven't really done anything closely related to tech itself rather than planning stuff with pen & paper about [Lem's](http://lem.pub) project future (some architecture-related stuff as I think I've missed something really important in the beginning)

## Life

Still playing [Celeste](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/celeste-ps4/) on PS4 (working on to complete the 5th chapter for 100% ðŸ˜Ž).

And big news! On 10.11.2020 I've beat my record (and my objective for 2020) for doing chin-ups! Finally reached 10 reps and since that day I've started doing series with 10 reps every time ðŸ’ª ðŸ”¥ Now working the same with pull-ups (which wasn't really my objective for 2020 but decided to improve these as well ðŸ˜‰)

Favorite song: [360 - Run alone](https://open.spotify.com/track/04Bkueyc8ZQ5P3bsci7uGg?si=3vgq6XtrTYWMxxz1_VbkAA) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Plan ahead. Train hard. Sleep well.
