> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

On Friday night I thought this section will be pretty empty as I haven't done much during the week because of various stuff that was happening (more about it below, in life section) but turned out that weekend (especially Sunday) was pretty productive.

I've learned a bit about [rollup.js](https://rollupjs.org/) - a module bundler that has pretty straighforward (comparing to e.g. [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)) syntax and is easier to start with from scratch.

I've managed to start working again on [writteli](https://github.com/writteli) project - already setup [helper lib](https://www.npmjs.com/package/writteli-lib) (far from production-ready version ATM) and started using it on writteli itself.

## Life

COVID-19 a.k.a. *coronavirus* is spreading across the world. This week Polish goverment took some serious steps to slow it down in our country. A bit stressful times in general.

To be honest, I don't think I've listened to any songs this week so.. no favorite ones this time.

## Summary

I hope we're be able to calm this pandemia quickly. I also wonder how bad it will affect world's economy in general and how long it's gonna take to get back to normal life.

For sure this is something that our kids will learn about at school.
