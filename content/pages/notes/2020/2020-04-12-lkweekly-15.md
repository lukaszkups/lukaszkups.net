> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

During this week I've been working further on my Vue.js json-based form generator and started customizing my website current writteli pipeline - I want to separate [#lkweekly](/notes/?category=lkweekly) serie from other kind of posts in the main blog notes list.

Also, despite all efforts I didn't manage to finish my newest article - since last week I'm tinkering the contents around but cannot form my thoughts good enought to be satisfied.

## Life

I've finished [Journey](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/journey-ps4/) game - gosh it's such a masterpiece üëç I've also came back to play [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) after 1 year break in the middle of the story. üéÆ.

Favorite songs: [Stan SB - Flat Foot Face](https://open.spotify.com/track/0H7fuaZWAXGvdZh7MB5KEp?si=8huFDRtDQnyq4STDIaswZg) & [culineR - Emerald Explosion (Kavvson League of Legends Theme)](https://open.spotify.com/track/4RVM3Fa3IE5sr0aheVtN9H?si=2SMKGOskSGy5xuyLOkIBZA) üéß

## Summary

Happy Easter everyone! Wish you all the best and please keep yourself and your loved ones safe in this weird (due to COVID-19) times ü§ó.
