> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Another busy week! Managed to release 2 [new](/notes/tavuelo-0120-release-notes/) [versions](/notes/tavuelo-0111-release-notes/) of [Tavuelo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo) package and started working on dedicated website for this package (built with [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli) of course! 😎).

## Life

[As I've mentioned](/notes/lkweekly-4/) some time ago, I have an announcement: I am joining [HICX Solutions](https://www.hicxsolutions.com/) dev team from tomorrow as a remote front-end developer! 🔥 ⌨️ 😎

I have also managed to get access (after recruitment process) to [Upstack.co](https://upstack.co) platform as a freelance contractor, available for hire in my spare time 😉.

Favorite songs: [Zomboy - Vancouver Beatdown](https://open.spotify.com/track/4BjK6hwNF7KZuT5sNTplbX?si=kr0HZ4ygQZ6VFV7Oj-RhPg) & [Enter Shikari - Juggernauts](https://open.spotify.com/track/3fitt5g65sz7NFbXFhQ75j?si=Bb8LVh3HSA62LN959VQHkA) 🎧

## Summary

Big life (work? 🤔) changes has come - I feel that incoming weeks will be even more busy than ever, but feeling excited and ready for new challenges! 💪 🔥
