> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

As I've mentioned in the [previous lkweekly](/lkweekly-12/) I've started working on multiple new projects. This week I was focused most on the one that will handle Vue.js forms in provided JSON object format. I decided to create 2 main modules for it - parser and WYSIWYG form editor.

## Life

Nothing spectacular, still playing [LEGO Marvel Avengers](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lego-marvels-avengers-ps4/) & started also playing [Journey](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/journey-ps4/) - can't figure out why I haven't tried this one earlier üéÆ.

I have also watched with my son [The LEGO Movie 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3513498/). While he's a huge fan of the first part I've noticed that this title had more stuff that might be interesting to kids a bit older than 5. Duh, I think I've enjoyed this part more than the first one as there was more funny quotes with hidden meaning here and there. Also, absence of the *"Everything is awesome"* song was a huge drawback.

Favorite songs: [Cloud 9+ - Sasquatch](https://open.spotify.com/track/3D7fCiY3zy2ay9l6KnqIIg?si=SgkT0f3cRCC2STfRQqc-TQ), [Cloud 9+ - When We Were Young](https://open.spotify.com/track/75QtXqJNXaEaB8JR38OUfr?si=qXmAPzRqRDqRD6BrIOTHZQ) & [Dakota Star - It's all about you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jI_NpFV70Y) üéß

## Summary

Keeping the flow, I don't remember if I ever had such long (non-full-time-work-related) commits streak on github before! üòé üëç
