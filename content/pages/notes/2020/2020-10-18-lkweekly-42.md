> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I've created the longest empty space in my side-projects commit history since summer vacations (6 days!).

I was basically very busy at my full-time job, but also learned a lot about love between Vue.js and Internet Explorer ðŸ™ƒ

## Life

No life has been recorded during this week. Only work & sleep ðŸ‘·ðŸ’ªðŸ˜´

Favorite song: [MUST DIE! - Skull Kid](https://open.spotify.com/track/0o7vuhH3VVILv6134M017c?si=oC2ZWnLPT-yvTz6i8WZQGg) & [Kase & Wrethov - Break Down](https://open.spotify.com/track/1h23yOmDbuQbqyeyC412AE?si=ciYEeu7qSIKFIOPNEyXMvQ) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

This is a first no-log.
