> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

I've continue working on formastic - library to create vue.js-powered forms (using buefy at the moment) from JSON-alike JavaScript Objects.

I have also gave a shot of a new approach of writing [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/) app - working now on the plain web interface part (also using Vue.js for that task) that I eventually try to embed into electron.

## Life

Still travelling through [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) world - I've pushed main story line a bit and learned about roots of the apocalypse 🎮.

Besides that, nothing much is happening - I'm at home due to COVID (and working remotely only deepens that state😉).

No favorite songs this time - just listening randomly what spotify suggests to me  <strike> 🎧 </strike>

## Summary

Keep calm and just continue working 👍.
