> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

This week I'm gonna make it short and straightforward.

## Technology

I'm working further on my new incarnation of the [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/) editor. Making some good progress!

## Life

Doing some home maintenance & small gardening work (new skills acquired! ðŸ’ª). No [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) this time ðŸ˜†.

Favorite songs: [Krewella, Arrested Youth - Anxiety](https://open.spotify.com/track/3MIDI56fBQenFrMMz2cO7i?si=e-BA2cYMTqqV7VSOFRin9w) again & [Protohype & Alina Renae - Fly](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Kx1twfUQNJYQOsMQRybTM?si=EdhI71ekQ7CaIkJ9fmMfwg) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Despite the fact I had a lot small side-tasks around the home, I'm very satisfied how the development of the new [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/) editor version is progressing.
