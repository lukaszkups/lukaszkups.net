> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I've been diving deeper into [ant design for vue](https://www.antdv.com/docs/vue/introduce/) library most of the time. I have also learned about a [nice library](https://github.com/CacheControl/json-rules-engine) that enables running various json-formatted condition statements and resolving different scenarios - pretty handy.

Besides that, I'm working on a new article (still in draft state) and started working on a small UI module (more info on release 😁).

## Life

Nothing spectacular - just another (very) busy week. One of my past freelance clients has come back to me with a new feature request to be developed on their website which I've done over the weekend as well 😉.

I have also learned how to upload own .mp3 files to Spotify library to be able to listen it online on various devices - good stuff, I can finally listen to my all time favorite band (Dakota Star ❤️) everywhere 😎

Favorite songs: [Dakota Star - It's all about you](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jI_NpFV70Y) 🎧

## Summary

I feel that everyday I'm shuffl...err... hustle. 🤵 💪 🏃 💼 🏋 🔥
