> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I was playing around with [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) (tool that enables creating desktop apps with web-based technologies) - it's really interesting, but I think I'll stay with [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) anyway (it's more suitable for my needs imho).

## Life

This week has went through so fast that I still hardly believe that it's already gone - mostly because of tons of work each day I have.

BUT! I've still managed to do some workouts and beat my previous chin up record - it's officialy now 8 reps! ðŸ’ª

Also, started playing [Maple Story M](https://maplestorym.nexon.com/) a little bit. I remember playing the PC version in its early days so I've decided to give it a try now on mobile. ðŸ“± ðŸŽ®

Favorite song: (still) [NO!NO!NO! - DoskonaÅ‚y PomysÅ‚](https://open.spotify.com/track/0bOnu6ndj564GHTFStfQze?si=KqF-KwgWRqS0xPRZg2mvjA) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Work, workout, rest, repeat.
