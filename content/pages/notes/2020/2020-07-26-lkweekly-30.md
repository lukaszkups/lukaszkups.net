> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Finally, I think I've found a most suitable solution for my writteli project - [Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) enables building *smaller, faster, and more secure desktop applications with a web frontend*. Based on a quick chit-chat with people on discord about it, I feel I'm totally sold for it (lot smaller bundle size, incoming feature that will enable build also mobile apps etc.). I hope I'll be able to find some time in the incoming week to actually finally start working on my app.

## Life

Lot of stuff is going on, especially in my daily time schedule of work/life 😉 🏢 💻

Didn't have much time for any leisure stuff, so no gaming info this week. 😞

Favorite songs: [NO!NO!NO! - Doskonały Pomysł](https://open.spotify.com/track/0bOnu6ndj564GHTFStfQze?si=KqF-KwgWRqS0xPRZg2mvjA) & [Stessie - Atmosphere](https://open.spotify.com/track/7q6XxSUzCu5Un9YP2ZGKsa?si=VnDVfNYoSeabtuLg68JEOw) 🎧

## Summary

Work, rest, repeat.
