> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Still exploring available options for [writteli](https://github.com/writteli) app development. I've been working also on English subtitles for my [Oppo Reno 3 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmmk_b0aY3w) (still WIP).

I've also created new youtube video - [Keychron K1 review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2hk54lsrCM) (in Polish, subtitles will be added later).

## Life

While enjoying my last days of holiday with the family, I've been searching for another keyboard that will suit for my needs - unfortunately, it turned out that Keychron K1 is not exactly the keyboard I'm looking for. (If you're from Poland and you would like to buy it from me - it's available [here](https://allegrolokalnie.pl/oferta/keychron-k1-v4-87-klawiszy-rgb-bronze-switch))

Still playing [Everspace](https://store.playstation.com/pl-pl/product/EP1547-CUSA10572_00-EVERSPACE0000000) from time to time - first steps in this game was a bit harsh, but after collecting some money and upgrading your ship, things started to be more interesting ðŸ¤”.

Favorite songs are the same as in the last week: [I See MONSTAS - Evolution (radio edit)](https://open.spotify.com/track/2pMJ0kMQDDmf6TXwzeS8Xp?si=55yu_f7HTnmxIstWS9LBZQ) & [Prefekt, Johnning - Numb (feat. Johnning)](https://open.spotify.com/track/2vWWV8jfEZDPJXB6x7VJra?si=_R9X_3JLQXaJttodVcgM4g) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Good times, wish summer never ends.
