> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I've been exploring available solutions for flat-file-based data storage and management (and thinking about implementing my very own one, for [Lem](http://lem.pub) project needs).

## Life

Autumn is here, spending more time at home than outside (unfortunately ðŸ™„). Started playing [Celeste](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/celeste-ps4/) on PS4 (some time ago I've played it on PC, but never actually finished it - this time I'm playing each level until I complete it for 100% ðŸ˜Ž)

No favorite songs this week ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Autumn is here.
