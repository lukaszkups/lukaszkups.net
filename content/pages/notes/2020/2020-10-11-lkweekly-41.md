> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

I've released 2 new updates for my first indie game - [BOINK!](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink). Fixed some bugs related to counting remaining balls in the level (so sometimes you stuck in empty one, or new level has been loading while 1 ball was still remaining on current one). I've updated welcome screen graphics & added new obstacles - BLACK HOLE, MAGNET and changed blue square into silver SAW BLADE.

You can read all release notes [here](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink/devlog).

Working in [Construct 3](https://construct.net) is a truly joy experience. After each day spent working with it I'm more closer to buying full license ðŸ¤‘ (but keeping myself away from it until I finish all goals related to [Lem development](https://lem.pub)).

## Life

I just don't know how this week has passed already. Most probably I've spent way too much time in the front of the computer (while I wasn't working at my full-time job I was tinkering [BOINK!](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink) game mechanics).

Favorite song: [The DNC feat. Chris King - Champion](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TXquxy1MpzMOo9pqWQJWY?si=ri95DtcvQra5yk1-gQyZFQ) (yup, it still rocks my headphones ðŸ˜€) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Indie life.
