> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

I had a really (REALLY) busy week at (full-time) work and I didn't have any spare time to work on any other projects. But as a side note I've learned this week about ![TipTap](https://github.com/scrumpy/tiptap) rich text editor for Vue.js - I've even played around a little bit with it, and I think I'll definitely will use it in my side projects.

## Life

Still hunting mecha dinosaurs at [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) world when I can't sleep ðŸ˜€ ðŸŽ®.

Favorite songs: [Nhato - Gekka](https://open.spotify.com/track/6BDUdwOnjVTGWJbsbOcm9V?si=P1lBHka1RVOOC4Ta-rkZbA) & [Jack Ãœ (Skrillex & Diplo) - To Ãœ (feat. AlunaGeorge)](https://open.spotify.com/track/3UgSQu6WwrXfKKDq019IHE?si=KigrmkrBShC003W7asGV1Q) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Time flows like a crazy when you're (like 16 hours-per day ðŸ˜²) busy. But as I've mentioned before, [shooting from bow in post-post apo world](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) will keep you sane - totally recommend it.
