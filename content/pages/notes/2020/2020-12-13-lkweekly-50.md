## Technology

It was a pretty decent week, regarding [Lem](http://lem.pub) development. I've made many customizations of the tooling I use for creating application modules (in design and behavior fields).

I've also found [this handy tweet](https://twitter.com/excalidraw/status/1337355475474669569) from excalidraw twitter account that enabled me to visualize my commits stats during the past year (my side-projects only):

As most of you might already know, on this week was [Cyberpunk 2077](https://www.cyberpunk.net) game premiere - I just couldn't not take that chance to promote my [BOINK!](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink) game a bit:

*I've shared this on my social media, to just remind people, that CP2077 premiere is not everything 😅*

## Life

It was a very busy week again - I hope I'll manage to solve my work-life balance problems a bit until the end of this year 🙄.

Besides that, I've finished yesterday [Celeste game](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/celeste-ps4/) on my PS4 - not yet on 100% but satisfied about it anyway 🙂.

Aaand Christmas tree is already waiting to be decorated 🙌🎄🌟🎁

Favorite song: [Myka, Relocate: Doublespeak](https://open.spotify.com/track/2UDCudAJo9UtVmUw9A9YhA?si=P0Xd4-uOT0KrC2ZH2Q464A) 🎧
