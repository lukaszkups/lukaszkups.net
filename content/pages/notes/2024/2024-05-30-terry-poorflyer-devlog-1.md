Dear Poorflyers,
I have learned recently about broken Steam Achievements, which made me really sad.

And you know what made me even more sad?

That by silly mistake I don't have access to Terry Poorflyer source code anymore 🤦🤦‍♂️🤦‍♀️

(fortunately I still have all assets and tilemaps🙌)

But don't worry, I have decided to re-implement Terry Poorflyer (again!), this time without any 3rd party closed-source framework wrappers (like it was with current version and Construct 3).

I'm also seriously considering open source the code once completed.

I cannot share any specific deadline when it will be ready & updated here on steam, but just wanted to tell you, that the game is not abandoned!

Wishing you all the best, and encouraging you to post any questions you have.

Best,

-- ł.
