## What is (or will be) Space Saga?

Some time ago I've came up with an idea of making a game about space adventurer, who will be able to travel from planet to planet, trade with aliens and learn about secrets that are spread across the galaxy.

Game would be split into different "modes":

- Galaxy map - you will be able to select planets you want to travel to, but you will be limited by your spaceship range (which you will be able to upgrade over time)

- Space Travel phase - while traveling to the planet, you will need to fly there (imagine *Galaxian*/*Galaga*/*Space Invaders*/*Gun Nac*/*Xevious*)

- Special Events - e.g. space pirates trying to board your ship, someone from your crew get sick or anything else you can imagine that can happen during space travels; In this mode you will be able to walk around your ship (in top-down view, like in retro jRPG games)

- When you arrive to your destination, you will be able to select (planet) area where you want to land and then travel by foot (this topic is still TBD really ðŸ˜‰) - most of the destinations will be hidden during first visits and you will unlock new of them during game

- Combat mode - I'm still struggling on decision with this one. I want this game to be a demake successor of Phantasy Star Online (1) game, which I am big fan of, but I don't really know if I want to make battles real-time, like in *Hyper Light Drifter* style or turn-based, like in classic jRPGs.

As you can see, this game will consist of various modes and I would love to develop all of them inside one game engine - that's why I've spend couple last weeks checking on what market can offer me (I was also thinking about building own engine from scratch, then I've switched to use [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) as my renderer, but in the end I've abandoned that idea as it would be way too slow approach).

## Game engines

Here's a list of game engines that I've checked, with a short description about my personal feelings about them (which might vary from yours, of course):

### Construct 3

My long time beloved game engine, I've already created some [games](https://lukaszkups.itch.io) with it, even [released one on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1935130/Terry_Poorflyer/) - it's really developer-friendly for smaller games, but I can't imagine creating comfortably something like to make now. Also yearly subscription fee is not cheap, which is the biggest flaw for me.

### Godot

It's very similar to Construct 3, but is more flexible and advanced (and most important - FREE). Similarly to Construct 3 it relies heavily on its editor really, which helps and disturbs me at the same time ðŸ˜…. Biggest flaw for me here is that I doesn't offer coding with JavaScript/TypeScript out of the box (it offers GDScript, C++ or C# instead).

### Excalibur.js

I do really like this engine! Its approach to extend built-in classes (mostly `Actor` ðŸ˜…) really speaks to me and is really intuitive as to someone, who comes from web development world.

This engine is one of my top choices among others in this list. The biggest downside is its version - at the day of writing this article it's still in v0.29 (so not really yet even close to v1.0 ðŸ˜ž) and from what I've noticed in the [changelog](https://github.com/excaliburjs/Excalibur/releases) it still have regular breaking changes which is a big no-no to me at the moment ðŸ˜ž.

### PlayCanvas

Honestly, I don't really know why it's not more popular in the market - this engine looks like a web equivalent mix of  [Pixi.js](https://pixijs.com/) + [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US) + [Unity](https://unity.com/). It's web UI editor is really powerful, engine itself offers great performance and it has free tier for everyone to create games with it. It uses JavaScript as its main coding language. 

So it's amazing, but does it have any flaws? 

Actually yes - for my particular scenario I think I don't need THAT ADVANCED tool, the learning curve seems a bit too shallow for me at the moment and the engine/editor itself, seems a bit more focused towards 3D than 2D games imho.
