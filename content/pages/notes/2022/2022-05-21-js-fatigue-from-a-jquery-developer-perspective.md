> After almost 5 years working as a web developer I had to change my workplace - and found out that my skills are irrelevant

My career started from self-employment and trying to compete full-fledged creative studios with offering my skills as a web-developer / designer / video editor / any other creative activity that you can do in front of your computer ~2010.

After 3 difficult years I've decided to switch to a full-time job for someone else (a.k.a. employer) - so that I've landed in software house that was creating its own internal tool ([ERP-type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning), to be exact).

I've spent 3.5 years in that company, where I was juggling between jQuery, Apacha/Cordova and some bits of pure JavaScript.

Because of various reasons, company that I was employed in, had to shutdown in the first half of 2017 - so that I had to find a new place to work.

And gosh, during those years a lot of stuff happened!

Now we've got various front-end frameworks that were using their own rendering solutions based on shadow DOM (and what's the shadow DOM in the first place?!), there were tools like compilers, bundlers that was transpiling, compiling, uglyfing, minifying stuff for you with their complicated configuration files etc.

> I was sooo late to the modern stack JavaScript party.

And while I've been trying to catch up with everything, there were so many things been released in the meantime that becomes *next hot thing* that drove me nuts!
