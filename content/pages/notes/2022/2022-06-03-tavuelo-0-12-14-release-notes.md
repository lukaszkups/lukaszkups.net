> Tavuelo is my first open source package. It is a easy to use yet highly customizable table component, created for use in Vue.js projects.

# Changelog

While some of you might think that I've already abandoned [Tavuelo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo) I've updated it! No big changes though, some maintenance changes:

- updated (where possible) dependencies that had any security vulnerabilities (fortunately, only `dev` dependencies have it, so you can sleep well ğŸ™‚)
- replaced `node-sass` dependency package with `sass` (finally! ğŸ™Œ)

I do really hope I'll be able to give this package more love soon (as I'm now super-turbo busy at work ğŸ‘·ğŸ’¥)

Enjoy!
