# Sharing your salary - is it worth it?

In short - no.

Besides hidden intent of flexing your ego and *probably* some hopes that it's gonna help somebody I don't think it's gonna make any change.

This kind of some kind of transparency exists already - there is already dozens of anonymous online reports available that can show you how much people earn across the world. If you're at least a bit aware how these thing work you can adjust these numbers with some error margin that might occur while gathering data. Or just analyse couple different reports and take average number of it. In the end it doesn't matter about VERY EXACT number right?

I understand that most people who shared their salaries believes that it might make a change, but I don't understand really how.

Imagine this scenario: you're negotiating your salary at new / current job and company can't afford to accomplish your expectations (or - if you're remote worker - your offer doesn't apply for their salary calculation algorithm that they're using) what are you going to do - tell them that you've heard that people earns X or Y? Jokes aside please ðŸ˜‚ (yep, it's brutal, but I can't imagine someone expecting to be threated seriously by some big corp. with such approach)

Maybe you're not worth that much for the company.

Maybe that information was a lie and nobody earns that much there.

Maybe a company just want to screw you up and save some money.

Maybe there are other candidates that will work for less than you because they have smaller expenses.

There are tons of possibilities out there, but no clear solution besides honesty from employer side.

# You're the one that should know your worth.

If you're not happy with your current salary, re-think about your current situation - do you feel that you've achieved something extraordinary lately that nobody appreciated?

You can for example ask for a raise.

You can look for another job.

You can also discuss with your supervisor what you're expected to do/learn/improve (feedback) to level up as an employee and receive a raise.

# TO ALL HR / MANAGEMENT PEOPLE OUT THERE: sometimes just a verbal form of appreciation is worth more than thousand <strike>dollars</strike> words.

How many times you've got scolded because you've done something wrong?

And how many times you've heard kind words for doing a good job?

I bet first one occurred way more times than second.

There's a very strange culture that doesn't tend to promote even tiniest good achievements but (almost) always gives negative feedback about mistakes.

During my career I've been a part of various teams and learnt about its inside-manners out there. I do recall these which tend to give positive feedback for even smallest achievements as a best places to work at.

Don't get me wrong though - if you screw up there should be also some repercussions / feedback as well. But it's totally worth to keep it in balance.

# And speaking about that salary transparency again...

If you feel that you're being underpaid - check some online sources what's the median salary for your role in the area and try to get a raise.
