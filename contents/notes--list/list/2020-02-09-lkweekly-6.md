> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

At the beginning of this month I have released an update for [Tavuelo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo) package. Since then I have also decided to publish here [release notes](/notes/tavuelo-0910-release-notes/) of my work progress.

## Life

This week was meant for high quality family time ðŸ™Œ ðŸ˜Ž So as tiny as possible computer/coding time, spent it offline mostly ðŸ’ª.

Favorite songs: [Something Just Like This - Coldplay & The Chainsmokers](https://open.spotify.com/track/6RUKPb4LETWmmr3iAEQktW?si=bOsEviYiR3O08l17DS2_ig) and [Hymn for the weekend - Coldplay](https://open.spotify.com/track/3RiPr603aXAoi4GHyXx0uy?si=FvRieY_bQcGLVYyrFA28FQ) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Despite the fact I've spent almost no time in the front of the computer/code I found this week pretty satisfying - most probably because I've managed to release new version of Tavuelo ðŸ˜‰
