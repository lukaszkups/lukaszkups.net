> Couple days ago a friend of mine asked me: "How are you doing this? You have a full-time job, a family with 2 little kids and still find time to work on side projects?

## organize yourself

DISCLAIMER: I'm a father of two awesome kids and find it kinda blessed by the fact that they're sleeping well through whole night: until like 6 - 8 AM.

Ok then, but what's the key?

I've learned that it's possible to develop and maintain side-projects while keeping work-life balance but... you have to sleep less.

You might laugh or think that I'm a lunatic, but summing things simply that's the key.

My typical working day takes ~9 hours (8hrs of work + sum of all breaks in between). Then it's time to run some daily errands (grocery etc.) and family time. Around 21:00, when kids sleep already me & my wife finally have some time to spend together for 1-2 hours. After that time, most probably my wife is tired and go to sleep as well.

And that's my time for the hustle where I try to do something for another 2-3 hours (until 1 - 2 AM max)

But don't get me wrong - this is not my daily, 24/7 must-do plan. If I'm burned out I watch netflix or play some games. Sometimes I just go straight to bed as well because of fatigue, but then I feel somehow guilty that I've "wasted" my free time to go to sleep.

Yes, if I could choose to not have to sleep, I would be 200% more happy person (I hate sleeping, but it's not that I'm a workaholic - it's just a boring activity and I would rather spend it on something else).

I also try to fight with that feel of guilt, because I know that I can't cheat my body and from time to time I need to get a rest a bit more than usual.

So yeah, this is pretty everything about that. I've tried with my wife couple different scenarios such as:

- waking up early, so I can start working on something in the morning, but usually kids were waking up as well and it was impossible to spend this time on something different than morning babysitting,
- working on fixed short amount of time after my daily job ends was a failure as well - I've found that my brain often needs a longer break after couple hours of coding already to be efficient again on doing something else,
- work on side projects during the weekends - this is a big no-no - weekends are for family (again, except nighttime when everyone are sleeping already)

All of them were a better or worst bits of a failure - I think it's a very individual problem that everyone should solve exclusively just for their needs - what works fine for me, shouldn't exactly fit to you.
