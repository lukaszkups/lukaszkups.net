> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

During this week I've been continuing work on my *for-fun* project - a turn based strategy game, inspired by another game, [Into the breach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Into_the_Breach). Working on it the way I want and not exactly how it should be (using DOM, not canvas etc.) it's really refreshing. At the moment I've finished initial grid rendering and started working on turn logic and game state update.

## Life

Nothing spectacular, working on my for-fun project or playing *Into the breach* game to take some note ideas ðŸ˜Ž plus outdoor family time ðŸ’ª

## Summary

Still waiting though for the green light of my [Oppo Reno 3](https://www.oppo.com/en/smartphone-reno3-pro/) review - stay tuned.
