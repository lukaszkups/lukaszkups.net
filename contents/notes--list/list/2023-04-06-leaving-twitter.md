> &tldr; I can't stand the current state of twitter that is happening recently. My timeline is no longer showing me what I want to and it feels like I don't have any control about it. So I've decided to leave twitter and move to [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@lukaszkups). I hope that twitter will reborn one day.

# My first professional social media account

It was around 2009, during my first apprenticeship I've been introduced to the magical world of programmers: hackatons, programming conferences, [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website and most importantly - twitter.

I remember initial excitement when I've discovered that I can see what my programming idols are doing right now and how easy I can interact with them. I literally fell in love with this platform. 

I can say that I've been using it almost on daily basis (thank you, [FOMO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_of_missing_out)) for all this years (plus I've restarted my presence (account) there somewhere ~2017 because of reasons that even I'm not sure anymore ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è).

During that time I've met all kind of people - from superbly friendly to total douchebags - but thanks to constant moderation of my twitter feed/lists/circles I was spending my time there in totally healthy manner, learning mostly about topics I was interested in (programming, entrepreneurship, meteor.js and/or Vue.js frameworks and JavaScript ecosystem in general).

# Good times, bad times



# Summary

14 years is A LOT. And you can say that you've become a part of the community that you've belonged for so long time - and so do I feel that way!
