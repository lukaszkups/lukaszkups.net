> &tldr; I can't stand the current state of twitter that is happening recently. My timeline is no longer showing me what I want to and it feels like I don't have any control about it. So I've decided to leave twitter and move to [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@lukaszkups). I hope that twitter will reborn one day.

# My first professional social media account

It was around 2009, during my first apprenticeship I've been introduced to the magical world of programmers: hackatons, programming conferences, [hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/) website and most importantly - twitter.

I remember initial excitement when I've discovered that I can see what my programming idols are doing right now, how easy I can interact with them
