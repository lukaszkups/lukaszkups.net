> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I've made some fine progress of [Lem](https://github.com/lukaszkups/lem) development - created project folder structure validation & basic methods related to creating new project from scratch.

I've also [released new version](/notes/tavuelo-0126-release-notes/) of [Tavuelo](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) - due to silly mistake I had to bump 2 patch (+0.0.2) versions (so current version is [0.12.6](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo)). Update contains significant reduce of build bundle size.

## Life

Nothing special, I've started running again a little bit, while my son practices his bike riding skills ðŸš² ðŸ˜Ž

Favorite songs: [Timeflies - Beast](https://open.spotify.com/track/7vhSZcOyPl7rciJvle0oOW?si=cy14UKTiS2W-oktnEpCBCQ) & [Story of The Year - Home](https://open.spotify.com/track/2pVdM3U0sZ6kAareHI9uuU?si=py7VBQ-ISVSqmtkfpY6y0g) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

If you want it, run for it.
