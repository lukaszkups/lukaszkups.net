> Coronavirus is changing the world for sure. Above all the negative outcomes I'm trying to point out a positive one - remote work opportunities.

[Remote](/notes/truth-about-remote-work/) work surely is not for everybody. But many people though are hoping that having an option to work onsite or 100% remotely become a standard, not one of the rarest (and most wanted) benefit.

I am one of those people.

As some of you might already know, I work at least [partly remotely](/experience) during my whole career, and lately on full-time basis. I love it. It helps me keep the work-life balance without wasting time and nerves for commuting.

## When world becomes remote playground

Due to recent events, many companies has offered their employees an option to work remotely.

And based on what I see on my newsfeed, many employees is just screwing up their huge opportunity.

Some of them are people I personally know, some of them are just random folks from the internet I follow via social media.

Binge watching TV/HBO/Netflix shows, drinking beer, gaming online.

Slacking off has many names.

I believe some of these *activities* haven't been really made during their work hours and was just a joke.

Unfortunately I am 100% sure some of them were for real.

Instead of taking advantage of the received chance they threat it like some extra holiday time.

Thanks to unfortunate circumstances we now have one of a kind opportunity to show how remote work can **actually work**.

And what we're doing instead?

We prove that without supervision we are not able to do anything meaningful.

We show how little our employers can rely on us when we're really left to our own with work to do.

I know that sharing such photos/tweets/stories with snacks on desk and consoles turned on in the middle of the workday can be a joke - but is it really for our employer? Do you build up his trust with such this behavior?

So please, don't be that person.

I really hope that home office option will be the new open spaces from the early 2000s - extremely popular & with huge credit of trust from employers side, but way more suitable for doing actual work ðŸ˜‰.
