> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

Cleaning time! This week I was focused on cleaning up my personal laptop & installing latest Windows Insider update (2004).

## Technology

This week due to some health issues (note about that will be published in the next week) I wasn't able to perform any activities related to my side-projects. 

But I've managed to do a fresh-install of my OS (Windows 10) with latest build (2004).

Even it wasn't recommended for my machine yet (Surface Book 2) I've tried to install it anyway (as I would clean everything anyway so in worst case I would have to do it again if something won't work). I did it because I've wanted to use [WSL 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/) on my primary machine ðŸ˜Ž

## Life

I struggle currently with health issues - to be more precise: I suffer from an occupational disease ðŸ˜ž (wrist pain) - it's 3rd time in my career actually ðŸ˜’ - but this time I think I've found the exact cause of it (more info soon)



Favorite songs: [Timeflies - Beast](https://open.spotify.com/track/6LxYLEHqoPvKDyhoTU0d9F?si=SdaJKcgaQc2GNVzTjJGhDw) & [Protohype & Alina Renae - Fly](https://open.spotify.com/track/3Kx1twfUQNJYQOsMQRybTM?si=EdhI71ekQ7CaIkJ9fmMfwg) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

No pain, no uninterrupted gain.
