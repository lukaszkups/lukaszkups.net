> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I've finished working on custom `select`/`dropdown` component for my [Lem](https://github.com/lukaszkups/lem) project. Started working on article editor (using [tiptap](https://tiptap.dev/) plugin for this).

I've also [released](/notes/tavuelo-0128-release-notes/) a 0.12.8 version of [Tavuelo](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) package - it contains fix for `noDataSlot` feature to support wide notification row (using appropriate `colspan` for that).

## Life

Work, work, work & some family time in between.

Favorite songs: [The DNC feat. Chris King - Champion](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TXquxy1MpzMOo9pqWQJWY?si=ri95DtcvQra5yk1-gQyZFQ) & [Pez & Hailey Cramer - Can't Wait](https://open.spotify.com/track/0ZHXOBkZfnSqhZQ86kYto2?si=81zdDBebRBOaM7pFoP_w7Q) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Work, work, work.
