Windows Phone OS and Lumia smartphone line was the greatest thing that happened for mobile market (in my opinion). Period.

No matter how little you would spent on the device, you could be 100% sure that it will never let you down (or slow down!).

Despite the fact that Lumias were very similar to current Android phones in terms of the design, there was something special about these devices - maybe it was the display or rubber minimalistic cases (❤️) but I feel that modern smartphones are lacking with that magic *something* in their form.

# Metro (Modern) UI

Ah, the tiles - words can't describe how much I love the idea behind them. I think it's the most ergonomic solution for touchscreen interfaces:

- they're big, so you can click on them without fear of misclick

- the *live tile* feature is far more handy than simple counter of unread notifications (or whatever app wants inform you about)

- minimalism at its best!

- great match with whitespace and fonts used!

- subtle yet complementary animations

- lightweight implementation - it runs smoothly on all kinds of devices (from budget to flagship ones!)

- since Windows Phone 10 release you could use advanced customizations of the UI

# Screen display

Let's say it aloud - modern hight-end smartphone models are too big - their screens are at least 5 (almost 100% frameless) inches of size. I have just launched my Lumia 800 which has 3.7" display - nowadays it might seems to be a bit too small, but not uncomfortable to use (especially with one hand). Maybe 4.7" one from Lumia 735 would be more appropriate due current standards. As a average hand size person, devices that has screen size bigger than 5" becomes too big to use comfortably.

The other great thing that Lumia serie had is ClearBlack display - to very this day I ask myself why this hasn't become a standard? I remember using Lumia 800 during the very sunny days of summer wasn't a problem at all. Now I need to enhance brightness of my android device to at least 90% even during cloudy winter days while outside.
