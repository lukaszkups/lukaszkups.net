## Technology

This week I've started working on multiple projects - just to not get bored of working on single one.

In short:

- Writteli library - an extensive set of helper methods that helps you build your very own static site generator

- Writteli - an opinionated setup of writteli library that will be backward-compatible with existing writteli (so I can use it for managing this website without need of changing anything). It will work also as an example presentation of how you can use writteli library itself.

- Raw JavaScript live tile plugin that will enable creating similar UI element that you could've seen in Windows Phone OS - just for fun.

- A Vue.js plugin that will enable creating forms based on provided JSON structure.

Besides that - great news! Wikimedia [has announced](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T241180) that they're adopting Vue.js! It's also worth to take a look on a tweet from Vue.js creator, Evan You what [does it really mean](https://twitter.com/youyuxi/status/1240635308141613056).

Other good news are especially for creatives: Affinity offers a [50% discount for all their products](https://twitter.com/affinitybyserif/status/1240673159898107905) because of COVID-19.

## Life

Yesterday I've turned 31 - gosh, times goes like crazy 😄

Besides that, [#COVID-19](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23COVIDー19) and [#StayTheFuckHome](https://twitter.com/hashtag/StayTheFuckHome) topics are unfortunately still trending everywhere :biohazard: :house:

I've also started playing with my kiddo [LEGO Marvel Avengers](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lego-marvels-avengers-ps4/) - so cute & funny game 🙂 🎮

Favorite song: [culineR - Emerald Explosion (Kavvson League of Legends Theme)](https://open.spotify.com/track/4RVM3Fa3IE5sr0aheVtN9H?si=2SMKGOskSGy5xuyLOkIBZA) 🎧

## Summary

As you can see I'm more busy than ever! But planning more leisure time next week 👍 I hope I'll actually manage to make it happen 😆

Take care everyone!
