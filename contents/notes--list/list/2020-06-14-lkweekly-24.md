> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

Summer is almost here (in Poland). The great weather is a huge demotivator for keeping up with side-projects.

## Technology

This week I've spend mostly with configuring [WSL 2-related](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/wsl-2-is-now-available-in-windows-insiders/) stuff on my fresh Windows 10 installation on my personal machine.

I've also gave a try to [Haxe](https://haxe.org/) (as a potential alternative to [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) that I've chosen as a main tool for one of my side-projects).

## Life

As I've mentioned - great weather tempts to spend more time outside (and so I do that ðŸ˜Ž) and that's one of the reasons why I haven't finished yet couple articles I keep in draft mode for weeks already ðŸ˜ž.

Favorite songs: [Fox Stevenson - Out of my head](https://open.spotify.com/track/5kDWUDSzrEaozsWC4KC9m1?si=6tqyHkLNQ0uCg3FqpLBbDA) & [Terminite, PsoGnar - Senses Overload](https://open.spotify.com/track/5uvJFkaN571MYOyNODQtze?si=7Nj7g9P7Q0yJ6abHGb_21Q) & [Fox Stevenson - Simple life (original mix)](https://open.spotify.com/track/1kqzX1bb6vPZgk7hHfMkKc?si=Un6TPK1ESE67Epm8CQTc7A) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Go outside, let yourself fall in summer daze ðŸ˜Ž ðŸŒ´
