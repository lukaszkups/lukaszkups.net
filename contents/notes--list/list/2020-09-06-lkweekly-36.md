> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

That was a really busy week - working continuously on [Lem](https://github.com/lukaszkups/lem) - I've created multiple helper components that will be used all across the app in various places. I've also found out how to build & bundle it into `.exe` file (it required some tinkering regards project structure).

New week means new [release](/notes/tavuelo-0127-release-notes/) of [Tavuelo](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) - it contains fix related to search feature - I've spotted it while *dogfooding* Tavuelo in Lem app ðŸ˜Š

## Life

Quoting last week:

> Nothing special, I've started running again a little bit, while my son practices his bike riding skills ðŸš² ðŸ˜Ž

This week was very similar ðŸ˜‰

Favorite songs: [MÄ™skie Granie Orkiestra - Wataha](https://open.spotify.com/track/0JD4U7FeIirQ6RkOyV6NxN?si=lhPs9m1VTLG_PAKDBObm6A) & [ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE - Microphone Check](https://open.spotify.com/track/2YnFjnqWdDvrc5L5UWIF70?si=QcYNxaYDRsWCatonmhkFhA) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Really satisfied with the progress of Lem project. I hope next week will be as productive as this one.
