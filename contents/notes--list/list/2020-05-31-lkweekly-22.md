> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

This week I was very busy at my full-time work so I'm gonna make it short and straightforward again.

## Technology

Working further on my new [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/) version - working on initial screen design with list of saved projects. Found out great open source icon set - [Feather Icons](https://github.com/feathericons/feather).

Besides that, have first semi-final draft (probably!) of the color palette: <span style="color: #f6f7fb">#f6f7fb</span>, <span style="color: #b9bfcb">#b9bfcb</span>, <span style="color: #2a9df4">#2a9df4</span>, <span style="color: #1167b1">#1167b1</span>.

## Life

Nothing spectacular, due to loosening restrictions related to social distancing (COVID-19 in Poland situation) and great weather, I've finally could do something that simple like going outside with my family for a walk again - good times 👪 👍

I've also bought a pull up bar - I've never ever been any good in this kind of exercises (I was actually really bad at it, like, 1-2 pull ups in the serie was my best achievement). Realizing that it doesn't change over time (I still do max 2 pull ups) was no surprise to me - I've set my goal to achieve 10 pull ups by the end of this year (which seems pretty unrealistic for me after 1 week of workouts, but we'll see 😉)

No favorite music at this week <strike> 🎧 </strike>.

## Summary

Work + workOUT mostly.
