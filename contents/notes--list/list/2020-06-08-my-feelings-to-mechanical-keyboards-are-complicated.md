For the last couple years I was a huge fan of mechanical keyboards. I love the *click-clack* sound of each keypress - it's so relaxing while solving difficult programming problem or when releasing new version of one of your [side](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) [projects](https://github.com/writteli).

I own already 2 pieces of [Drevo Gramr 84](https://www.drevo.net/product/keyboard/gramr) keyboards - one of them was intended to use at the office, the other one at home (now I use only one of them as I work 100% remote).

Unfortunately, things has changed recently.

Or actually, it happened 3rd time to me already, but I wasn't able to connect stuff together.

But lets start from the beginnig:

I fell in love with Drevo Gramr 84 keyboard. It has very compact and programmer-friendly layout (especially the most-right column of keys to navigate quickly through code ðŸ’›).

What's very important to me while choosing peripherals it has USB cable to connect & power-up (I don't like devices which can run out of battery in the middle of the day).

Over the time, like any self-respecting mechanical keyboard fan I've customized my keyboard with brand new keycap color layouts.

Good times.

But then, not-so-funny things has happened. I've started struggling with wrist pain (which is really annoying for someone who is typing for a living for 10+ hours a day). 

> DISCLAIMER: it's not something like little headache - such pain is comparable more to teeth-alike pain (really, REALLY uncomfortable)
