> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

I think autumn blues has got me (or it is just a matter of overall situation in Poland ðŸ¤”) - I just didn't have any motivation to work on anything side-project related really.

The bright side of it is that I've read more technical blogs and got inspired by its themes (yeap, I'm thinking about redesign, but wanted to do it using alpha version of [Lem](https://lem.pub) (which is not yet ready ðŸ™„)

I've also started writing an article about casual player thoughts on next-gen consoles, but the more I work on it, the less I want to actually publish it ðŸ™ƒ

## Life

This week I've spend more time on leisure - started playing [Islanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islanders_(video_game)) again. Also found a litte gem for Halloween time - [Little Nightmares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Nightmares) ðŸŽƒ

No favorite songs this week ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Time-off blues.
