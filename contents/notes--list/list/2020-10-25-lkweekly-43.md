> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Regarding [Lem development](https://lem.pub), this week I've been focused mostly on its design aspects. I've browsed tons of various applications & interface designs, seeking inspiration for final color palette & aescetics.

At the same time, I've started prototyping another small game using [Construct 3](https://construct.net). Most probably I won't do anything further besides simple proof of concept, until I finish working with Lem and buy full version of Construct itself ðŸ™‚ Once again I've learned that Construct is really an awesome tool for fast prototyping - I've made a simple (animated) walking ninja sprite with ability to trigger attacks in like 15 minutes ðŸ™‚

## Life

I took the opportunity that the weather is beautiful here in Poland so spent all the available free time after work outside with my family ðŸ‘ª

No favorite songs this week.

## Summary

Inspiration seeking & indie game prototyping.
