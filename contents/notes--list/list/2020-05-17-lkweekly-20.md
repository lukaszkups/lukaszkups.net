## Technology

I've decided to make a rebranding of my most important side-project -[writteli](https://github.com/writteli/) - it now becomes... it's really a secret for now - will announce it in the near future ha! ðŸ˜Ž

Besides that, I've started refreshing my knowledge about [meteor.js](https://meteor.com) framework ðŸ“š as I thought it might be handy when working on writteli desktop app but...

...all of sudden I've took second approach to [NW.js](https://nwjs.io/) - and it was totally a pure joy to work with this time! Everything started working just as I've wanted to, without any extensive configuration (I'm thinking about you, electron ðŸ˜’) - I hope it will stay like that until the very end of development.. ðŸ¤ž

I've also learned about [alpine.js](https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine) - a micro framework that might be a light alternative to Vue or React. I've even thought for a moment about using it as a main rendering engine for writteli desktop app, but I haven't found quick answers for a couple of questions I had after reading alpine's documentation so I've abandoned that idea.

## Life

Guess what? [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) disc is still spinning in my PS4's drive ðŸŽ®.

Also, reminder to everyone - besides this week free GTA V at Epic Games store, you can also obtain Lego Ninjago game, for almost any common platform (PC (via Steam), PS4 or XBox).

## Summary

Work hard, play hard - but also try to take it easy from time to time ðŸ˜‰
