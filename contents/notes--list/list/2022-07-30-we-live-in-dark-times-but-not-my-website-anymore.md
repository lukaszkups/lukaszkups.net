For the last [3 years](/notes/cant-kill-progress/) my website was designed with gold & black colour palette (inspired by Deus Ex: Human Revolution game) - but not anymore!

Since I've started working in [game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1935130/Terry_Poorflyer/) [dev](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/) in my spare time I was thinking about my website redesign - how it should look like? Should I keep my dark aesthetics? But my games are soo colorful!

So yes, I've switched the colors basically.

The new leading color is HTML compliant - ~~`#4682B4` or SteelBlue - I will miss my gold variant but it was simply unreadable for bright color palette.~~ - it's <span style="display:inline-block; width: 1em; height:1em; background: #FFA500;"></span> `#FFA500` or just good old [Orange](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/color_tryit.asp?color=Orange)!

Besides color swap I've planned to create a subsections for each leading topic on my website (gamedev, (web) programming etc.) but it's still WIP as it requires some additional work in my static site generator insights.

As you've might already notice I've also added some category colors for blog post tiles so you can differentiate topics via its background colors ðŸ‘€
