> LkWeekly is my personal project of making notes each week with short summary what I was up to.

## Technology

Working further on [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli) desktop app. During the process I've learnt about electron's [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/script-src) and Chrome sandbox which caused me huge headache until I've learnt that at the moment it's impossible to run it via WSL on Windows (so I had to switch from WSL's bash to Windows default terminal). Also working on configuration for Vue.js package inside electron without CLI or additional bundlers.

## Life

This week I've come back to [work](https://qcontact.com) - it wasn't that bad as I thought it be (after so long break in December). Fortunately I continue my 7 to 16 work schedule so I have time to spent with my family & on side projects.

Still playing [Hyper Light Drifter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1661802484/hyper-light-drifter) and [Starlit Adventures](https://starlitadventures.com/) ;)

Favourite songs: [Oranek - Wiosna](https://open.spotify.com/track/5ihgFEYhrIxeGOBXW9T3bE) (Polish rock, English title: *Spring*) and [Lanberry - PiƒÖtek](https://open.spotify.com/track/1w50goPGfSC4GGy7TMPRdQ) (Polish pop, English title: *Friday*) üéß

## Summary

This week was OK. I hope on the next week I'm gonna progress more on writteli desktop app development. üëç
