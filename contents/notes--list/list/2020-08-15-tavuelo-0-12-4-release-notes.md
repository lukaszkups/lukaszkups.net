# Changelog

This release contains fixes for dependencies:

- main: `core-js`,

- dev: `@vue/cli-plugin-babel`, `@vue/cli-plugin-eslint`, `@vue/cli-service`, `babel-eslint`, `eslint`, `node-sass`, `sass-loader`, `vue-template-compiler`, `acorn`, `minimist`

Some of them had moderate and high level security vulnerabilities and couldn't be resolved automatically. All current known issues has been covered, so we should be good for now 👍
