> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This was a crazy week. Always thought that things before Christmas should slow down a bit, but this year it was the other way around.

I haven't worked much on my side-projects during these days; just some small steps forward regarding [Lem](http://lem.pub) UI core.

Revisiting also one of my old articles about creating/setup Vue.js + NW.js project (coming soon).

## Life

Christmas tree decorated & gifts packed under it already! ðŸ™ŒðŸŽ„ðŸŒŸ

## Summary
