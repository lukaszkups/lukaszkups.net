> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

[Lem](https://lem.pub) development in progress - I've finished all features related to managing `pages` (flat-file CRUD), now working on similar functionality but for `articles`. Building also `dropdown`/`select` component for that feature.

## Life

Nothing spectacular, unfortunately struggling with lots of work & first colds ðŸ˜•

Favorite songs: [The DNC feat. Chris King - Champion](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TXquxy1MpzMOo9pqWQJWY?si=ri95DtcvQra5yk1-gQyZFQ) & [The DNC feat. Chris King - Champion](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TXquxy1MpzMOo9pqWQJWY?si=ri95DtcvQra5yk1-gQyZFQ), but also [The DNC feat. Chris King - Champion](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TXquxy1MpzMOo9pqWQJWY?si=ri95DtcvQra5yk1-gQyZFQ). Oh, did I mention [The DNC feat. Chris King - Champion](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TXquxy1MpzMOo9pqWQJWY?si=ri95DtcvQra5yk1-gQyZFQ) as well? (yes, I'm kinda obsessed with that song at the momentðŸ™ƒ) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Working hard with the Champion.
