Today my friend asked me how to get the value (date) from bootstrap's date input. My first thought was like:

```
var myDate = $('input').val();
```

But instead of value I've got `""` (an empty string). I've inspected the input element in DOM and it was actually right behaviour - that input had no value.

Luckily, after little search I've found the solution:

```
var myDate = $('input').data('date');
```

And that's it - enjoy!
