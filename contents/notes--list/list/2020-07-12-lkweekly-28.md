> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

I'm exploring the concept of changing my personal website into [Digital Garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden). This week I've been playing around a bit with the layout, searching for some inspiration etc. Everything still powered by the [writteli](https://github.com/writteli) of course 😉

## Life

Holiday time! 🌴 Enjoying my 1-week time off with my family 😎

My Oppo Reno 3 video review has been published - you can see it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qmmk_b0aY3w) (warning: it's available only in Polish at the moment - subtitles coming soon).

This week I've got my [Keychron K1](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k1-wireless-mechanical-keyboard) delivered - review coming soon (both text & video - I've really liked the youtube format of reviews - maybe I'll start doing more video content in the near future 🤔)

I've also started playing [Everspace](https://store.playstation.com/pl-pl/product/EP1547-CUSA10572_00-EVERSPACE0000000) - I've never been a big fan of space simulators / shooters but this one has interested me a bit recently.

Favorite songs are the same as in the last week: [Fox Stevenson - Out My Head](https://open.spotify.com/track/61DAPU5DrMAyvAWU4jQ0Lx?si=HAYpbI7HQEOrV3EngZt5fw) & [Timeflies - Beast](https://open.spotify.com/track/6LxYLEHqoPvKDyhoTU0d9F?si=1ZyD3zQhRwenivthB9ghhA) 🎧

## Summary

Quoting PEZ & Hailey Cramer:

> For those summer days, summer days
> Oh, summer days, summer days
> For those summer days
> I love summer days
