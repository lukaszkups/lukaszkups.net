> Around 13 months ago I've found out that I was overweight and wanted to change something

Staying slim and fit is hard. Especially if you sit in the front of the computer ~12 hours per day and have a family of 4 (me, amazing wife + 2 awesome kiddos).

Around 13 months ago I've found out that I was overweight - having 93kg while being 183cm height was not the form I've dreamt of. For the most of my teenage years I was known amongs my family as *that more than an average sporty guy* - playing footbal, running or training acrobatics was on my regular weekly schedule.

When I started my journey at the Tech University, things has changed - learning, freelancing, not-so-much-but-still-a-bit-partying lead me from ~75kg to 90kg+ state.
