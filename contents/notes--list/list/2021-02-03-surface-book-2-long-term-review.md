# Beauty & the beast

Since the premiere of the very first Surface Book iteration I was in love of the overall ascetics of this device. The timeless silver magnesium finish looks astonishing in any environment. Add minimalist finish with subtle air vents hidden from user sight on top of that and there you have it - an almost sci-fi alike piece of art.

*This. 100% THIS*

Besides terrific design, this 15" slim beauty contains raw power. Quad-core, 8-th gen i7 processor, 16GB of RAM, dedicated GeForce GTX 1060 graphic card and real-world 8 hour battery life was an unbeatable offer during its premiere in 2017 (not even mentioning here the one-of-its-kind 2 in 1 form factor).

# The good, the bad, the hinge

Is this mechanism any good? Of course. Do you think that Microsoft should change it? Definitely.

While it does its job perfectly, it will often gets in your way - especially if you're planning to be very mobile with it.

No matter if you choose 13" or 15", the hinge has its *gap* when closed, which makes you feel really uncomfortable to put it into backpack or anywhere else besides your table/laps.

I've read other users scary stories on reddit about how they've wanted to pick up their devices but grabbed (with lid closed) it too hard and tension just broke it (similarly to their owners hearts & wallets) into pieces.

Let's make it clear - despite its power Surface Book product line seems to be a very precious egg - and I mean an uncooked one here.

I was hoping that in 3rd Surface Book iteration Microsoft redesign its mechanism so it will close flat - unfortunately we still need to wait, maybe 4th gen will introduce some changes in that regard.

After 2 years of using this device, I can tell you 2 things about it: the hinge mechanism still amazes me how cleverly designed it is, but sometimes my fear about how fragile this device seems to be in overall drives me crazy.

# Surface Book 2 does not live by hinge alone
