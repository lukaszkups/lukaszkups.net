> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This is the first time I can't share much information here - I haven't worked at all on my any side-project, mostly because the tasks I have at my [full-time job](https://www.hicxsolutions.com/) are that much exciting that I do them in a bit of extense so I don't want to do anything else at the moment ðŸ˜‰

## Life

Enjoying the great weather with the family ðŸ˜ŠðŸŒ´

Besides that I've hit my new life record of [chin ups](https://www.google.com/search?q=chin+ups&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwjUtcCglbfqAhXsAXcKHZFdDZoQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=chin+ups) - 7 reps! ðŸ’ª (If you don't know already last month I've started training on the bar and I've set a goal to the end of the year to hit the 10 reps) For the whole life my personal best record was 5 reps (and that was like 15-20 years ago!)

Favorite songs: [Fox Stevenson - Out My Head](https://open.spotify.com/track/61DAPU5DrMAyvAWU4jQ0Lx?si=HAYpbI7HQEOrV3EngZt5fw) & [Timeflies - Beast](https://open.spotify.com/track/6LxYLEHqoPvKDyhoTU0d9F?si=1ZyD3zQhRwenivthB9ghhA) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

I feel great & recomend doing bar workouts for all those who spends most of the time in sitting position.
