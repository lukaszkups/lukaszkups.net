First, some backstory:

> I've been trying gamedev couple times already. Building something from scratch, using Vue.js as a support tool, learning various game engines like Phaser or Godot. But I've never go through "playing around wiht it" phase. In other words: I've become bored and unmotivated because of slow progress while trying to make my ideas come to life.

But this has changed when I've tried out [Construct 3](https://construct.net).

Thanks to youtube channel of the game dev that uses Construct, [Vimlark](https://www.youtube.com/c/Vimlark) I've got hyped into this tool before I've even launched it. Watching his videos was so relaxing and enjoyable experience.
