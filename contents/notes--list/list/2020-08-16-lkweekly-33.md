> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week I've tried to push further development of [Lem](https://github.com/lukaszkups/lem) (desktop app CMS that generate static website) - working currently on initializing most basic project structure. Besides that I've also managed to [release new version](https://lukaszkups.net/notes/tavuelo-0124-release-notes/) of [Tavuelo](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) - had to manually update some dependencies because of outdated codebase and to fix known vulnerabilities.

## Life

Continue playing [Phantasy Star Online 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1056640/Phantasy_Star_Online_2/) - it's very PSO1-ish for me, which is both good and bad thing - I feel that slowly I'm getting bored because of its very repetitive gameplay.

I've also managed to beat my chin up record - 9 at the moment (I've felt I could go with 10th but it won't be perfect). Also slowly getting better will pull ups - 4 reps per serie now ðŸ’ª ðŸ”¥

Favorite songs: [Rootkit, Anna Yvette - Against the Sun](https://open.spotify.com/track/1suR7O1Coqso76HSw1zVa9?si=nCv81HCgQiigwBKynP4wmQ) & [The Streets - Everything is Borrowed](https://open.spotify.com/track/2BKO62jJN0ZgaeL5GrGIsr?si=2wEiKFHkTZybGRfXMQeyWA) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Code-fixing, side-project'ing.
