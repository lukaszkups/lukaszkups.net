> Yesterday, my good friend sent me a message with a question: *Dude, what are you doing? Why are you liking so many posts on linkedin lately?*

Here I come with the answer.

[As some of you might have noticed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaszkups/detail/recent-activity/) I've started binge-liking posts on linkedin.

If you watch closer, you might see the pattern of posts category I like most.

Because of recent events, many people has lost their jobs all of sudden.

I know how does it feel like - especially if you're not a single anymore and have a family to support on monthy basis.

It's very simple yet might change something - just click *like* button below any post about people looking for new job opportunities. Couple days ago I've realized that this is something I can do on daily basis, without any significant commitment, but still can help someone.

## Most <strike>developers with overgrown ego</strike> people use linkedin wrong

Let's make it clear: if you're using somewhat actively linkedin platform and you read all these messages you receive from recruiters about new potentially lucrative job offers then it's just a kind move to answer them - even if you're not interested.

Personally, I have like 2 or 3 response templates that I sent to recruiters. I can share one of them with you:

> Dear XYZ,
> Thank you for the offer, but I'm not currently interested because ____. But please lets stay in touch.
> Best regards,
> ł.

The decline reasons are varied: sometimes the tech stack is not something that I want to work with (I'm talking to you, React/Angular offers), sometimes the jon positions are completely random (.NET/PHP/Java/Ruby on Rails backend role offers) or other (e.g. I'm not actively looking right now etc.)

But most important - you're giving a feedback.

You might not be looking for a job, but there might be plenty of people that are in really difficult work-life situation and would do anything for such opportunity. Maybe recruiter is waiting for your reply before she/he send another job offer to somebody. Or maybe your click on *like* button will make a difference in linkedin alghorithms and that post will be seen by somebody that is looking for someone with that skillset.

Based on what I hear from my fellow dev friends I sometimes feel that they keep their linkedin accounts as a punishment (wtf?).

If you don't like receiving tons of job offers, maybe just close the account?

But in the end it's your account, do what you think is appropriate.

But please, don't be a linkedin asshole.
