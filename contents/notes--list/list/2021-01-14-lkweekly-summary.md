> Lkweekly was my biggest 2020 personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Purpose

I've started writing dev/life notes on weekly basis because of general burnout I've suffered in 2019.

Time was passing through so fast in 2019, days were blurred together like a fog in the cold, autumn morning.

So I've decided to collect, organise and archive my thoughts throughout the year.

## Some statistics

During the 366 days in 2020 I've written 52 [#lkweekly](/notes/?category=lkweekly) notes. 49 of them has been released on Sunday, 3 notes has been postponed with public release (because of *reasons* ðŸ™„) to Monday.

Average duration of writing these notes was 55 minutes.

All of the articles contains 52238 words that are written by using 348800 letters in total.

Whole serie was seen by ~11k unique visitors, most of them lives in the United States, France, Germany, Canada & Sweden.

*Some countries from this map was a little surprise for me*

## Thoughts

I feel that maitaining such series on regular basis was a huge motivator for me. Every week I had that feeling in the back of my head what I will write about past week - so I had to do something ðŸ™‚ That might be one of the reasons about so [many commits](https://github.com/lukaszkups) I've made in the past year.

*Those are my only private contributions (not including any activity from my full-time job)*

Despite the feeling of being boosted for execution each week, around [#37](/notes/lkweekly-37/) issue I've become a bit overwhelmed. It was that part of the year where I didn't have much free time to do any extra work with my side-projects and I had to focus on my & family health issues (fortunately not COVID-related ones!). For a couple following weeks I've found motivating myself to write more difficult than usual.

Maybe that was *just* a temporary burnout about the whole process.

During that specific time, I've switched my side-project focus from [lem](https://lem.pub) & [tavyelo](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo) into learning how to make games using [Construct 3 engine](https://editor.construct.net/).

And gosh, that was a clever move.

Over 4 weeks time span I've created 2 simple games: *[BOINK!](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink)* and *[Ok, broomer](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/ok-broomer)*. It was a good reset for my mind - I've basically switched context from what I had during whole year in my head so I could focus again on my (side-project related) priorities & writing weekly summary notes.

## Wrap-up

This whole [#lkweekly](/notes/?category=lkweekly) project was a really interesting experience for me. For the whole year I wasn't really monitoring stats of how many people I'm reaching to with this serie and I was positively surprised with the final numbers when preparing this summary article.

It was also a good exercise of making writing on regular basis a habit. Despite the fact I was a bit tired of it halfway through I actually feel a bit weird now when I'm not writing anymore during the weekend.
