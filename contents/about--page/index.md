## Front-end engineer

Hi, I'm Łukasz Kupś - a web developer from Poland with 10+ years of experience working on client & server side of web applications.
I love creating nice and useful things for the Internet people.

At the moment I feel most comfortable in working on Vue.js-powered Single Page Applications. Don't get it wrong though, I totally believe in *can-do* mindset and learning other frameworks shouldn't be a huge problem - in the end it's just a tool (that said I also know basics of React.js).

During my career I also had pleasure working on mobile apps built on top of JavaScript, Phonegap & Cordova. Wordpress theme development from scratch is not a problem for me either.

I like to co-op with Ruby on Rails and Django devs, who provides me APIs for creating beautiful and useful frontend interfaces. I have also built couple simple endpoints using Node.js/Express.js by myself as well.
