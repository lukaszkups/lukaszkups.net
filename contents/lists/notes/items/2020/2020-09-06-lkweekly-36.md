> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

Basically, I could copy-paste last week's note here - I worked further on [Lem](https://lem.pub) - created `input` and `tag` component that handles validation rules passed via JSON and now adding autocomplete feature.

One slight difference is that there's no new releases of [Tavuelo](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) - as any new bugs hasn't been spotted so there was no need for that ðŸ˜‰

## Life

It's almost autumn at my place - and so my gardening skills raises again:

Favorite songs: [MÄ™skie Granie Orkiestra - Wataha](https://open.spotify.com/track/0JD4U7FeIirQ6RkOyV6NxN?si=lhPs9m1VTLG_PAKDBObm6A) & [ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE - Microphone Check](https://open.spotify.com/track/2YnFjnqWdDvrc5L5UWIF70?si=QcYNxaYDRsWCatonmhkFhA) ðŸŽ§

## Summary

Again, really satisfied with the progress of Lem project. I (againðŸ˜Š) hope next week will be as productive as this one.
