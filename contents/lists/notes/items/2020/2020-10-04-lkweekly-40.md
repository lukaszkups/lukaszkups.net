> Lkweekly is my personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.

## Technology

This week was totally different than usual.

Why?

I've created my very own first indie game - BOINK! You can play it [here](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink).

During this week I've managed to release [2 updates](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink/devlog) related to its gameplay - I've also started already writing an article with details about the whole process 😎.

## Life

This was very busy week, but also managed to spend some fun time with my family on some weekend family trips & with my son, who was beta testing my game 🎮 😁

Favorite song: [The DNC feat. Chris King - Champion](https://open.spotify.com/track/2TXquxy1MpzMOo9pqWQJWY?si=ri95DtcvQra5yk1-gQyZFQ) (yes, again 😀) 🎧

## Summary

Am I an indie game dev now? 💻 😃
