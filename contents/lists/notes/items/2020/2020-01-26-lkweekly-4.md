## Technology

As you already know, I'm working on desktop version of my static site generator - [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli). After struggling back and forth with different Electron.js configs, I've got annoyed because of unexpected complications while working on Windows WSL & initial bundle size of the app (pretty empty app had size of ~250MB!) I've decided to try something else - [Proton native](https://github.com/kusti8/proton-native).

So what's now?

It's an environment to create desktop apps using React.js syntax. And because I know only very basics of this tool I've decided to extend my knowledge by completing the [React.js course on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

So yeah, basically I am now learning React.js.

I have also again redesigned my website - there's no more bright version of it.

Why?

It's no secret that I really like the web designs made by [Andrew Kim](http://minimallyminimal.com/) or [Oliur Rahman](https://oliur.com). While preparing bright version of my 2020 theme I was inspired heavily by their websites (even if it wasn't visible at all ðŸ˜‚). At first I was satisfied with the output, but after some time I began to feel that it's not exactly my website style - so I decided to switch back to my darker color palette ðŸŽ¨.

## Life

Big changes are coming - but that's the announcement for another post ðŸ˜‰.

Besides that, I've watched with my wife [Last Christmas](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8623904/) - and unexpectedely I totally recommend this movie! It's a romantic comedy, with a bit of a drama, but have a pretty surprising (sad(?)) plot twist! ðŸŽ¥

No fav songs this time, as in free time I'm listening to [Maximillian Schwarzmuller](https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/) voice during React.js course ðŸ˜‚.

## Summary

To be honest - it was a pretty weird week. The new direction of writteli development and some other incoming changes has made my life a bit crazy. But hey, in the end changes are exciting! Stay tuned ðŸ˜ƒ
