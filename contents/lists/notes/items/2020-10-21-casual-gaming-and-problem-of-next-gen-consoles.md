First, let's just confirm something:

> I'm a 100% casual gamer

Ok, since we're on the same page, let's move on..

## Current-gen (PS4, XBOX One) state

[Some](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/123288/Study_66_Of_US_Online_Population_Are_Casual_Gamers.php) [studies](https://www.limelight.com/resources/white-paper/state-of-online-gaming-2019/) I've found around the Interney says that around 50 - 65% of gamers considers themselves as *casual gamers*. That's a lot.

And, as I feel I'm a part of this team, I think a lot of those people can relate to my feeling about current state of the game industry.

I think we have reached the point where current hardware can serve us very beautiful looking <strike>images</strike> games. It's not something we can say photo-realistic yet, but overall aescethics can be really beautiful. Let's take [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/), latest [God of War](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA07408_00-00000000GODOFWAR) or [Forza: Horizon 4](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/forza-horizon-4/9pnqkhfld2wq) as an examples. These games looks really nice and really doesn't matter for casual gamers that they're not running gazillions FPS in 8K resolution ðŸ™ˆ.

## My current feelings about next-gen (PS5, XBOX Series X)

In the recent weeks my newsfeeds are literally bombarded by tons of news about upcoming console premieres.

And Oh-my-gosh I'm already sick of it.

Besides long awaited (at least by me ðŸ˜‰) Horizon: Zero Dawn sequel (can't wait for it ðŸ˜ƒ) and next Final Fantasy (I'm disappointed that it's not sci-fi ðŸ˜”) games there's nothing exciting really that would make me want to buy next generation at the moment.

Which <strike>is</strike> might be fine (at the moment).

Mentioned earlier games  hasn't been released on their platforms premiere. Moreover, God of War might be one of last big & very successful AAA title for PS4 ðŸ•¹.

Playing further as a devil's advocate I remember that Sony announced a game called [Knack](https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA00068_00-KNACK00000000000) as their starter title for PS4. I remember that I didn't get it how on earth it was something that should help sell their new consoles - it was neither very pretty or fun looking (based on the trailer materials (which, [it turned out](https://www.metacritic.com/game/playstation-4/knack) wasn't really that great)).

But what's my point? Well, at the moment the most promoted PS5 game seems to be a [Godfall](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/godfall/) - it's
