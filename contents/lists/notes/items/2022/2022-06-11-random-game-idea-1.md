> Random Game Idea is a serie where I write down a brief summary of game I would like to work on.

Imagine [Battle City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_City) / [Tank Force 1991](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Force) but with mechs, extra abilities (permanent upgrades maybe?), different biomes and various mission types ðŸ¤”

I'm even thinking that maybe non-linear levels could be a nice idea ðŸ’¡

And add on top of that random level generation and we've got a hit ðŸ™Œ

What do you think?
