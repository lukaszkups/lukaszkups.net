> Yesterday, my good friend sent me a message with a question: *Dude, what are you doing? Why are you liking so many posts on linkedin lately?*

Here I come with the answer.

[As some of you might have noticed](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lukaszkups/detail/recent-activity/) I've started binge-liking posts on linkedin.

If you watch closer, you might see the pattern of posts type I liked most.

Because of recent events, many people has lost their jobs all of sudden.

You can imagine how does it feel like - especially if you're not a single anymore and have a family to support.

It's very simple yet might make a significant change - it's just a clicking *like* button under any post from people looking for new job. Couple days ago I've realized that this is something I can do on daily basis, without any significant commitment, but still it might help someone.

## Many <strike>developers with overgrown ego</strike> people use linkedin wrong

<!-- --Let's make it clear: if you're using somewhat actively linkedin platform and you read all these messages you receive from recruiters about new potentially lucrative job offers then it's just a kind move to answer them - even if you're not interested.-- -->

Most of my fellow programmer friends doesn't really like this platform. They complain about receiving lots of jobs offers even they're not currently thinking about any change. All of them declined though when I've asked them if they put any information in their headline that they're not currently interested in new job offers. Also, majority of them don't reply

On

<!-- annoyed because of amount of received job offers. -->

Personally, I have like 2 or 3 response templates that I sent to recruiters. I will share one of them with you:

> Dear ____,
> Thank you for the offer, but I'm not currently interested because ____. But please lets stay in touch.
> Best regards,
> ____

The decline reasons are varied: sometimes the tech stack is not something that I want to work with (I'm talking to you, React/Angular offers), sometimes the job positions are completely random (.NET/PHP/Java/Ruby on Rails backend role offers) or other (e.g. I'm not actively looking right now as I've just started new project/contract etc.)

But most important - you're giving a feedback.

You might not be looking for a job, but there might be plenty of people that are in really difficult work-life situation and would do anything for such opportunity. Maybe recruiter is waiting for your reply before she/he send another job offer to somebody.

Same for liking posts from people that are looking for a job: maybe your click on *like* button will make a change and linkedin alghorithms will show this activity to someone from your contact's list who is looking for somebody with this particular skillset.

Try to put yourself in someone else shoes who lost his/hers job due to COVID-19 - you would probably want to reach out to the widest recruiter audience as possible.

But in the end it's your account, so do what you think is appropriate.

But please, don't be a linkedin asshole.
