## Right now

Currently I'm working on [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli) - static site generator that I've used to build i.a. this website. I'm also <strike>working hard on releasing version 1.0.0 of [tavuelo package](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) (my open-source table component for Vue.js-powered web applications)</strike> hunting mecha dinosaurs with Alloy in [Horizon: Zero Dawn](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn-ps4/) game ðŸ˜Ž.
