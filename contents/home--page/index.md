## Right now

Currently I'm working on desktop version of [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli) (static site generator used to build i.a. this website). Decided to go electron.js-less route and mastering react.js currently to build the app using [Proton-native](https://proton-native.js.org/#/). I'm also working hard on reaching version 1.0.0 of [tavuelo package](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) (my open-source table component for Vue.js-powered web applications).
