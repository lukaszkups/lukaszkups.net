## Right now

Currently I'm working on Lem (previously called [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli)) - static site generator that I've used to build i.a. this website, but packed into desktop application (writteli was build as a CLI tool). In the meantime I've also work on [tavuelo package](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) (my open-source table component for Vue.js-powered web applications).
