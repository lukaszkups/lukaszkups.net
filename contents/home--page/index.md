## Right now

Currently I'm working on Lem (previously called [writteli](https://github.com/writteli/writteli)) - static site generator that I've used to build i.a. this website, but packed into desktop application (writteli has been developed as a CLI tool).

In the same time I've also work on [tavuelo package](https://github.com/lukaszkups/tavuelo) (my open-source table component for Vue.js-powered web applications).

I've also started creating some [indie games](https://lukaszkups.itch.io/) using Construct 3 recently - I do this most often when I feel that my mind needs some *reset* & rest from web development.
