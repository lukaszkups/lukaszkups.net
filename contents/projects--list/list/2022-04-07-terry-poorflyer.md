My first PC game that has been released on Steam (made with Construct 3 game engine).

Inspired by retro side-scrolling platformers, Terry Poorflyer adds own "stomp" flair to it, handled by physics engine more advanced than in HL3! (or, at least at the time this description has been written)

Collect all the coins on the way to gain a perfect score and help Terry fund a brand new (used) plane to continue his adventures!
