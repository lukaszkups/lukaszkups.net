  <p>Coronavirus is changing the world for sure. Above all the negative outcomes I'm trying to point out a positive one - remote work opportunities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="/notes/truth-about-remote-work/">Remote</a> work surely is not for everybody. But many people though are hoping that having an option to work onsite or 100% remotely become a standard, not one of the rarest (and most wanted) benefit.</p>
<p>I am one of those people.</p>
<p>As some of you might already know, I work at least <a href="/experience">partly remotely</a> during my whole career, and lately on full-time basis. I love it. It helps me keep the work-life balance without wasting time and nerves for commuting.</p>
<h2 id="when-world-becomes-remote-playground">When world becomes remote playground</h2>
<p>Due to recent events, many companies has offered their employees an option to work remotely.</p>
<p>And based on what I see on my newsfeed, many employees is just screwing up their huge opportunity.</p>
<p>Some of them are people I personally know, some of them are just random folks from the internet I follow via social media.</p>
<p>Binge watching TV/HBO/Netflix shows, drinking beer, gaming online.</p>
<p>Slacking off has many names.</p>
<p>I believe some of these <em>activities</em> haven't been really made during their work hours and was just a joke.</p>
<p>Unfortunately I am 100% sure some of them were for real.</p>
<p>Instead of taking advantage of the received chance they threat it like some extra holiday time.</p>
<p>Thanks to unfortunate circumstances we now have one of a kind opportunity to show how remote work can <strong>actually work</strong>.</p>
<p>And what we're doing instead?</p>
<p>We prove that without supervision we are not able to do anything meaningful.</p>
<p>We show how little our employers can rely on us when we're really left to our own with work to do.</p>
<p>I know that sharing such photos/tweets/stories with snacks on desk and consoles turned on in the middle of the workday can be a joke - but is it really for our employer? Do you build up his trust with such this behavior?</p>
<p>So please, don't be that person.</p>
<p>I really hope that home office option will be the new open spaces from the early 2000s - extremely popular &amp; with huge credit of trust from employers side, but way more suitable for doing actual work ðŸ˜‰.</p>
