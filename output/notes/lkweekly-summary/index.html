  <p>Lkweekly was my biggest 2020 personal project about making devlog + lifelog notes on weekly basis.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>I've started writing dev/life notes on weekly basis because of general burnout I've suffered in 2019.</p>
<p>Time was passing through so fast in 2019, days were blurred together like a fog in the cold, autumn morning.</p>
<p>So I've decided to collect, organise and archive my thoughts throughout the year.</p>
<h2 id="some-statistics">Some statistics</h2>
<p>During the 366 days in 2020 I've written 52 <a href="/notes/?category=lkweekly">#lkweekly</a> notes. 49 of them has been released on Sunday, 3 notes has been postponed with public release (because of <em>reasons</em> ðŸ™„) to Monday.</p>
<p>Average duration of writing these notes was 55 minutes.</p>
<p>All of the articles contains 52238 words that are written by using 348800 letters in total.</p>
<p>Whole serie was seen by ~11k unique visitors, most of them lives in the United States, France, Germany, Canada &amp; Sweden.</p>

<em>Some countries from this map was a little surprise for me</em></p>
<h2 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h2>
<p>I feel that maitaining such series on regular basis was a huge motivator for me. Every week I had that feeling in the back of my head what I will write about past week - so I had to do something ðŸ™‚ That might be one of the reasons about so <a href="https://github.com/lukaszkups">many commits</a> I've made in the past year.</p>
<p><img src="/static/github-streak-2.jpg" alt="img" /><br />
<em>Those are my only private contributions (not including any activity from my full-time job)</em></p>
<p>Despite the feeling of being boosted for execution each week, around <a href="/notes/lkweekly-37/">#37</a> issue I've become a bit overwhelmed. It was that part of the year where I didn't have much free time to do any extra work with my side-projects and I had to focus on my &amp; family health issues (fortunately not COVID-related ones!). For a couple following weeks I've found motivating myself to write more difficult than usual.</p>
<p>Maybe that was <em>just</em> a temporary burnout about the whole process.</p>
<p>During that specific time, I've switched my side-project focus from <a href="https://lem.pub">lem</a> &amp; <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo">tavyelo</a> into learning how to make games using <a href="https://editor.construct.net/">Construct 3 engine</a>.</p>
<p>And gosh, that was a clever move.</p>
<p>Over 4 weeks time span I've created 2 simple games: <em><a href="https://lukaszkups.itch.io/boink">BOINK!</a></em> and <em><a href="https://lukaszkups.itch.io/ok-broomer">Ok, broomer</a></em>. It was a good reset for my mind - I've basically switched context from what I had during whole year in my head so I could focus again on my (side-project related) priorities &amp; writing weekly summary notes.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap-up</h2>
<p>This whole <a href="/notes/?category=lkweekly">#lkweekly</a> project was a really interesting experience for me. For the whole year I wasn't really monitoring stats of how many people I'm reaching to with this serie and I was positively surprised about the final numbers when preparing this summary article.</p>
<p>It was also a good exercise of making writing on regular basis a habit. Despite the fact I was a bit tired halfway through it I actually feel a bit weird now when I'm not writing anymore during the weekend ðŸ™‚.</p>
