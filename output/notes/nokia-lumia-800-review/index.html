<p>To be honest, I don't really like many Microsoft products (yeah, that's a nice kind of intro), but Windows Phone 7+ system is one of their greatest achievements - in design and software field.</p>
<p>Most of my early smartphones was based on Android OS. I've never been fully satisfied about any of them.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong: Android OS is a really nice product but there's one particular reason that drives me crazy about it: stability and reliability. Many times when I needed to do something on a smartphone really quick, Android failed me(slowed down or totally freezed). This kind of failures is unacceptable for a ~1000PLN (~290USD) device.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in November 2011 Nokia announced and started to sell Lumia devices with Microsoft's Windows Phone 7 OS. Despite the reluctance to products from Microsoft company I was fascinated about Metro (later renamed but adopted by nobody to Modern UI ) and Nokia's Lumia phone design.</p>
<p>After first reviews about WP7, I started thinking about switch. Despite lack of customization options and very, very small amount of apps in its market I've finally bought my first WP7 phone - Nokia Lumia 800.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It has been three years since I've bought Lumia 800. And it is so far the longest used phone by me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the meantime I've bought HTC 8X with new, Windows Phone 8.1 OS. I've sold it after couple days of use because of very short battery life. I also had a pleasure using Lumia 920 as my temporary second phone, and it was awesome experience.</p>
<h2 id="the-good-the-bad-the-charger">The Good, the bad, the charger</h2>
<p>As I mentioned earlier - I'm really impressed about Metro design. In my opinion, Windows Phone 7+ is the clearest and most beautiful mobile system ever. Its simplicity and directness of data presentation layer makes WP7+ most useful and user-friendly operating system for smartphone.</p>
<p>The device itself forwards purity &amp; elegance of Lumia's design line. The phone case is built from polycarbonate single-piece unibody (which means producer prevents from battery replacement) with minimum amount of physical buttons: Volume Up/Down, screen lock and camera trigger.</p>
<p><img src="/static/1514936626844-lumia_07chrgr.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Besides physical buttons, Lumia 800 has 3 touch icons at the front panel: back, home and search. Besides their regular purpose, we can access all opened applications by holding down back button for ~1sec.</p>
<p>(Most)Ports placement is also a plus for Nokia's design team. They're practically invisble during everyday usage - placed on top side of the phone. To access MicroUSB charger port or SIM tray we need to open small covers. On the other hand I can't appreciate placement of 3.5mm audio port on the top side - I prefer bottom one because I have a habit to keep phone upside-down in my pocket - I think it's more natural way of storing phone by most users.</p>
<p><img src="/static/1514936579758-lumia_004.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>Some people also can grumble about the fact that Nokia's device doesn't support external cards - in my opinion 16GB of mass memory is just fine.</p>
<p>Same thing can be said about the screen - 3.7" AMOLED display for some people can be enough, but personally after playing some time with Lumia 920 I think 4.5" is more comfortable for someone with average-sized hands.</p>
<p>The phone itself is pretty heavy - 142g for 116.5mm x 61.2mm x 12.1mm device can be felt as little too much, but again Nokia's engineers and designers have done a good job: Lumia 800 is a really well-balanced piece of equipment.</p>
<p><img src="/static/1514936564187-lumia_03.jpg" alt="img" /></p>
<p>In the box with Nokia Lumia 800 phone I've found another very unique item - the charger. When someone would ask me what thing reminds me of Bauhaus design trend, then I would answer - Lumia 800 charger. It's an example of simple and well thought out form of product design. I think this is the only charger in the world which impresses just looking at it.</p>
<p>You can also unplug its USB cable and use it e.g. as a data transfer connector for another device(its pretty common these days but not by every phone crafter - so anyway it's worth mention - remember that this phone was released about 3 years ago).</p>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>
<p>Nokia's first Windows Phone device is - in my honest opinion - one of their greatest. Battery life is pretty good (after 3 years of use I can still work ~2days without charging), the display works very nice (thanks to AMOLED) even at very sunny days. Camera works pretty fine - also in (at least fine) artificial light.</p>
<p>The Windows Phone 7.8 system works very well (even if it's no longer supported). Today I would recommend it for non-power smartphone users (myself included) who needs a device with good navigation app (Nokia Here+ maps are the greatest navi ever), to check e-mails, take some photos or connect with social networks &amp; internet.</p>
