  <p>Around 13 months ago I've found out that I was overweight and wanted to change something</p>

<p>Staying slim and fit is hard. Especially if you sit in the front of the computer ~12 hours per day and have a family of 4 (me, amazing wife + 2 awesome kiddos).</p>
<h2 id="road-to-obesity">Road to obesity</h2>
<p>Around 13 months ago I've found out that I was overweight - having 93kg while being 183cm tall was not the form I've ever dreamt of. It was even more disturbing, because for the most of my teenage years I was known amongs my family members as <em>that more than an average sporty guy</em> - playing footbal, running or training acrobatics was on my regular weekly schedule.</p>
<p><img src='/static/giphy1.gif'/><br><em>Yes - that was me in ~2009</em></p>
<p>When I started my IT journey at the Tech University things has changed - learning, freelancing, not-so-much-but-still-a-bit-partying and lots of junk/fast food lead me from ~75kg to 90kg+ state.</p>
<p>Years has passed, more and more kilograms has come. There was ups and downs with short-term diets and trainings but after couple weeks I was coming back to starting point (90kg+ weight).</p>
<p>But last year I've decided to change this. Permanently.</p>
<h2 id="road-to-success">Road to success</h2>
<p>My first step was to change eating habits. Nothing fancy though: just reduced amount of junk food per week and daily dose of candys. It doesn't mean that I've got rid of them totally, oh no - just takes 1-2 small sweets instead of 5-6 - you can easily notice the difference.</p>
<p>I have also switched from Coca-Cola / Pepsi to Cola Zero / Pepsi Max (no sugar). Yes, I'm aware of sweeteners used in them, but it's like coffee for me (especially during summer time) - I drink at least 1 glass of it per day.</p>
<p>After this change I've found out that I've stopped gaining weight. That was enough motivation to start working out.</p>
<p>So the next step was to start running. Not daily, not even every other day - having a full-time job and family takes tons of energy &amp; time.</p>
<p>I've started running when I can. During my lifetime I've learnt that I take most of the training (if I want to lose weight) if I perform it on an empty stomach, in the morning.</p>
<p>The key is to start small - my first tranings were around from 3 to 6 km (at its best) long, with average pace around 8-9km per hour.</p>
<p>Comparing it with my current distances (7-10km) and speed (9-11 km/h) shows some progress that I'm totally satisfied with. My main goal was to be able to run through 10 km distance - I don't aim for running marathon or half-marathon, just wanted to achieve this distance and then just improve my time.</p>
<h2 id="road-to-results">Road to results</h2>
<p>During 13 months I've ran ~200 km and burned ~20408 kcal. The fact that I've lost 13kg in total (and to lose 1kg of fat we need to burn ~7000 kcal - found this info somewhere on the net) proves that we're burning calories long after we stop working out (and also it greatly boosts metabolism).</p>
<p>Losing weight is not rocket science. But it also doesn't happen without dedication and some planning (nothing fancy, just to find free time to go out -&gt; train -&gt; go back &amp; take a shower). Support from family members helps a lot (thank you, my dear wifey ;*)</p>
<p>I encourage you to take a first step for a healthier life. Spend some active time outside, breathe fresh air and You'll find yourself in better mood in no time. Changing wardrobe from Large size to Medium/Small can also make you smile as it did to me :)</p>
