<h2 id="in-2020-work-life-balance-became-an-issue">In 2020 work-life balance became an issue</h2>
<p>Because of pandemic (COVID-19 😓) hundreds of thousands of people all around the world became remote workers. Some of them was happier than ever, some of them was devastated. While this new situation was a real challenge for many people, I was actually happy.</p>
<p>As you might already know, I'm a <a href="/notes/dont-be-that-person/">huge advocate of remote work</a>. I've been working (in my spare time, besides full-time jobs) as a freelancer with clients from all over the world. For the <a href="/experience/">last couple years</a> I've finally started working remotely full-time which was somewhat my <em>dream come true</em> thing.</p>
<p>If somebody would ask me to self-esteem, I would say that I'm a rather hard working person. In 2020 I've worked more than ever. But not because I had to, it's because sometimes I've felt that I needed to add those extra hours to achieve something that I will be satisfied with in the end of the day.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, most issues I've worked on this year was - because of variety of reasons - pretty complicated/difficult (you name it!). To achieve progress I've worked longer many times, but never complaint about it (as I'm doing such things only when I feel necessary so nobody will have anything to complain about my overall peformance).</p>
<p>In addition, I've started working on <a href="/projects/">various side projects in my spare time</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, this was a pretty tough year, in terms of work-life balace.</p>
<p>PS. Regarding workplace itself, it was a year of change. In the beginning of the year I've switched projects and joined a newly formed front-end team at <a href="https://www.hicx.com/">HICX</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>While <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue.js</a> framework doesn't have any secrets for me anymore, I've learned a lot about working with advanced, pure JavaScript-based libraries and their pain points when trying to do something veeeeery custom with them (I'm talking to you, <a href="https://www.ag-grid.com/">ag-grid</a>😒).</p>
<p>Thanks to my side projects, I've learned also how to <a href="/notes/lets-create-desktop-app-using-vuejs-and-nwjs/">integrate Vue with NW.js</a> in a pretty unusual way.</p>
<h2 id="personal-growth-stats">Personal growth stats</h2>
<p>564 contributions (235 more than in 2019) - that's the amount of commits I've made solely to my own projects (not counting those from my full-time job) 💪 🔥 I hope I'll manage to keep similiar level next year 😎</p>
<p>My <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1004946/lukaszkups">StackOverflow profile</a> basically lives its own life and gained (mostly) by itself extra 576 points this year (4545 in total right now).</p>
<p>This website has been seen by ~24k unique visitors in total (+6k more than last year).</p>

<h2 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h2>
<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>
<p>As weird as it might sound - I consume tons of business/tech/lifestyle related articles every day, but haven't finished any book this year (yeap, it's a shame, but I've decided to make this fact public anyway 😛).</p>
<p>I'm an active subscriber to classic Transformers comic book series though 📖 😎 (finished 40 issues already! 🤣)</p>
<p><strong>Movies:</strong></p>
<p>Referring to last year note: I've seen <em>Joker</em> (it was great!) 🙂 Still haven't seen <em>Ad Astra</em> &amp; <em>Parasite</em> though 😐.</p>
<p>It's difficult to mention any particular title that was extraordinary as many movie premieres has been postponed because of Coronavirus 😒.</p>
<p>But if not relying solely on 2020s productions, I'll say that <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6156138/"><em>37 sekanzu</em></a> (from 2019) totally nailed my movie lists seen in 2020! Even if you're not into Asian cinematography I recommend it to see just for the views.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8946378/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"><em>Knives Out</em></a> (2019) is worth to mention as well (it's my last movie I've seen in cinema so far! 😮) - great crime comedy with multiple plot-twists and an awesome cast.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt6987770/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"><em>Destination Wedding</em></a> (2018) - oh gosh, this movie have soo great comedy dialogues 🤣 Totally recommends this for good laughs!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5700672/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_3"><em>Zombie express</em> (original title: <em>Busanhaeng</em>)</a> - one of the greatest zombie movies that has been recently made (and this one is from 2016!)</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8404614/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>The Two Popes</em></a> (2019) - I was expecting something different (a mockumentary maybe?) But realising that it's a bittersweet comedy driven by two great actors was a positive surprise.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081505/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1"><em>The Shining</em></a> - yeap, I mean THIS movie, from 1980 - I've finally seen it 🙌 (and I regret I've postponed this for so long time!). Great thriller/horror, but I'm not sure what was the scaries thing there: sounds, Jack Nickolson or Shelley Duvall? 🤔</p>
<p>And last one: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7515456/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"><em>Hurricane</em> (also known as <em>Misson of honor</em>)</a> (2018) - despite poor CGI this movie is worth seeing (even just for the Iwan Rheon's creation sake 🙂) (IMPORTANT! Don't confuse this with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5475734/?ref_=nv_sr_srsg_0"><em>Squadron 303</em></a> movie - that one was awful! 😖)</p>
<p>I've started watching <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4786824/"><em>The Crown</em></a> serie on Netflix with my wife - I was every sceptic at first, but then positively surprised.</p>
<p>While being on (TV) series, I've watched also <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11147852/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1">Dorohedoro</a> anime - a really crazy fantasy/horror/comedy creation, great to relax mindlessly on the couch.</p>
<p><strong>Games:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://store.playstation.com/pl-pl/product/EP9000-CUSA11995_00-MARVELSSPIDERMAN">Spider-Man</a> (PS4) - damn, this game looks beautiful! And I'm really impressed how fast this game loads - kudos to developers from <a href="https://insomniac.games/">Insomniac Games</a>! 🙌</p>
<p>While I play mostly on PS4, in the end of this year I've also started playing <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/">Stardew Valley</a> on PC (soo relaxing experience!) 🙂</p>
<p>Besides those two, I still play from time to time <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon: Zero Dawn</a> (PS4), trying to beat it for 100% 😎.</p>
<h2 id="small-wins">Small wins</h2>
<p>I've managed to keep up with <a href="/notes/?category=lkweekly">writing my own weekly summaries</a> for the whole year!</p>
<p>I've beaten my life record (and goal to reach before the end of 2020) of doing chin-ups - I can officially announce that I'm able to do 10 reps! (before starting, my life record was 6 and it was from my teenage times!). Plan for 2021 - be able to do 10 reps of pull-ups (I'm at 4 at the moment 😓) and 20 of chin-ups! 💪</p>
<h2 id="small-failures">Small failures</h2>
<p>Due to lack of time (or bad time management 🙄) I've ran only couple times during this year (and I think it was LITERALLY a couple (2!) times 😓).</p>
<p>Despite the fact of spending many days on research &amp; prototyping Lem desktop app, I haven't reached the point I've imagined to (MVP at least 💔)</p>
<h2 id="plans-for-the-2021">Plans for the 2021</h2>
<p>Someone wise said once, that <em>telling God about your plans is the best way to make him laugh</em> 🙂 but I've decided to share it anyway:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Release <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo">Tavuelo</a> 1.0 (non-beta) version</p></li>
<li><p>Reach at least MVP state with Lem development</p></li>
<li><p>Rebuild/redesign my website, using Lem app 😎</p></li>
<li><p>Achieve my workout goals, run more again, loose weight and keep it under 80kg (I'm 81 - 83kg right now 🙄)</p></li>
<li><p>Spend more time with my family 💑</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-summary">Summary of the summary</h2>
<p>Do you remember when I've wrote that the year went so fast in my <a href="/notes/summary-of-the-year-2019/">last year summary</a>?</p>
<p>Well this one has gone like:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>January, February, March, Pandemic - and here we are, 2020 is over already</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Please, go to sleep 2020, you're drunk.</p>
<p>I hope we all have way better 2021, I wish you all the best and a happy New Year! 🎉🍾🎆</p>
