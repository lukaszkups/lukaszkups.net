<p>By the end of 2020 year, I've accepted an offer to work in <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.io/">Mercedes-Benz.io</a> - first as a sole front-end developer to develop an UI of internal product, and then I've been delegated to help with another product that is being developed by MB.io.</p>
<p>The transition to a new workplace was very smooth, even though I've agreed with my <a href="https://www.hicx.com/">previous team</a> to help them in free time when I will be able to.</p>
<p>So the first half of the year was like a marathon. I had to learn TypeScript that is being widely used at <a href="https://www.mercedes-benz.io/">MB.io</a>, develop new product in given amount of time* and try to help my folks from my previous project as much as I can.</p>
<p>*budget</p>
<p>So after 6 months, there was a first month that I was unable to do anything for my previous team. I've decided to split up at that point as it was very stressful for me and I was feeling guilty that I can't spend more time on work for them. I do really appreciate the trust that they've put in me and their willingness to cooperate with me on part-time basis. 💛</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>
<p>This year I've finally used to work with <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">TypeScript</a> 🙌 🔥</p>
<p>(I won't mention that I've <strong>learned it</strong>, as still I find some quirks from time to time that I need to google for to make it work with <a href="https://vuejs.org">Vue 2</a>).</p>
<p>Regarding my side projects, because of tons web-related work I've been into making simple, proof-of-concept games:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://lukaszkups.itch.io/tanki">Tanki</a> - a top-down 2D PvE shooter</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://lukaszkups.itch.io/super-zero-adventures-platformer">Super Zero Adventures Platformer demo</a> - a 2D platform game PoC</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://lukaszkups.itch.io/super-zero-adventures">Super Zero Adventures Exploration demo</a> - a Zelda-like single level game PoC</p></li>
</ul>
<p>I've also created one PoC using Vue, JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS - <a href="https://lukaszkups.itch.io/creeppy-labirynth">A Creepy Labirynth</a> (I was really inspired at the time by the approach of mimicking 3D/FPP perspective on 2D scene by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1097170/Backspace_Bouken/">Backspace Bouken</a> devs).</p>
<p>As you might notice, there was 2 games that shares <em>Super Zero Adventures</em> title - those were created as PoCs for a bigger, full game that I've wanted to develop one time. At the moment of writing this post I've stopped the development of it, but I've managed to create 3 levels with some cutscenes in between them.</p>

<p>You can see some of the available gameplay above (it was recorded when I had only intro, tutorial level and cutscene between 1st and 2nd levels).</p>
<h2 id="covid-19-situation">COVID-19 situation</h2>
<p>In November, I've got COVID 🤒. Fortunately, I've vaccinated myself twice, so I've gone through it in a pretty decent manner (I could compare it to a really bad flu, but I've totally lost my taste for 3 days). Fortunately everything is alright now (as I didn't have to visit hospital was a really good news).</p>
<h2 id="personal-growth-stats">Personal growth stats</h2>
<p>142 contributions (422 less than in 2020) - that's the amount of commits I've made solely to my own projects (but not counting those from my full-time job and the efforts I've made into gamedev (as those are not git-based but are being saved on personal cloud and loaded into <a href="https://www.construct.net/en">Construct 3</a> web-based editor)).</p>
<p>My <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/1004946/lukaszkups">StackOverflow profile</a> still lives its own life and earned 630 points this year (5175 in total).</p>
<p>This website has been seen by ~30k unique visitors in total (so again, an +6k growth in comparison to the last year). It's a really nice number, as this year I was really lacking of publishing anything new here (and last year I had an <a href="/notes/?category=lkweekly">lkweekly</a> project!). I assume that my acivity on social media has helped me with this (I've been putting screenshots/videos of my games there).</p>
<h2 id="social-media">Social media</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>twitter: (<a href="https://twitter.com/lukaszkups">@lukaszkups</a>): +33 new followers (139 in total)</p></li>
<li><p>instagram (<a href="https://instagram.com/lukasz_kups">@lukasz_kups</a>): same as last year, 117 in total</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="entertainment">Entertainment</h2>
<p><strong>Books:</strong></p>
<p>I was lazy this year and I won't hide it - I've ready only 2 books this year (Alien 1 and its sequel). I also read now way less online articles, as I've started relying more on couple weekly mailings instead (about programming / gamedev / webdev / front-end / Node.js / security).</p>
<p>I also continue my classic Transformers G1 comic book series 😁 (I'm at 70th issue now 😅).</p>
<p><strong>Movies:</strong></p>
<p>Referring to the last year note: I've seen <em>Ad Astra</em> (it was pretty nice, but I was expecting something else a little bit 🙂).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3829378/">Stephanie (2017)</a> - seen it by accident, but it's a pretty decent horror movie (shame that it had so little budget for CGI, but still, it's  movie).</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3567288/">The Visit (2015)</a> - another cool horror, has some creepy moments, also has a nice plot-twist in the end.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/">The Expanse</a> - I'm at 4th season right now - gosh, it's really great sci-fi serie!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1190634/?ref_=tt_sims_tt_t_1">The Boys</a> - this serie rocks! Imagine R-rated Avengers with more realistic, bittersweet life problems - can't wait for new season!</p>
<p><strong>Games:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon: Zero Dawn</a> - after beating it on PS4, I'm playing it now on PC. Must admit, it's way easier to fight with mecha-dinosaurs with mouse control 💪 🏹 🦎 🔥</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/752590/A_Plague_Tale_Innocence/">A Plague Tale: Innocence</a> - randomly started playing it out of curiosity, but I've got hooked into the main story to be honest 🐁</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/414340/">Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</a> - one of the best games I've played in 2021 (as I've created a <a href="/notes/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-game-review/">dedicated article about it</a>).</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/337000/">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a> - one day, I'm gonna finish this game (started 3 times already)..</p>
<p>Honorable Mentions:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> - while I don't really play it regularly (in contrast to my son 😁) I think this is one of the most astonishing title in terms of graphics in 2021.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.xbox.com/pl-PL/games/store/moving-out/9NXPBSMHPLTV">Moving out</a> - this game is soo cool to play with someone (e.g. your kid 😁) - tons of laughts &amp; fun!</p>
<h2 id="small-wins">Small wins</h2>
<p>There was a couple family/personal related ones, which I'm gonna keep for myself 😁</p>
<p>Besides those above, I'm really happy that I'm finally working full-time with TypeScript 💪 🔥 (as I couldn't/didn't want to/had-many-more-ideas/excuses for other things to do than force myself to learn it properly earlier 😅)</p>
<h2 id="small-failures">Small failures</h2>
<p>I dunno to be honest… Not working enough on my side-projects maybe? But I've spent that time on my reset/leisure time so I was able to function somehow between one 12+ hours-long day of work (so I REGRET NOTHING in that case haha 😆)</p>
<h2 id="plans-for-the-2022">Plans for the 2022</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Work again on <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tavuelo">Tavuelo</a> package (bump dependencies, add missing functionalities etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Start working again on Lem app (?)</p></li>
<li><p>Go back to regular workouts - I'm basically at the same place as in the beginning of 2021 (or maybe even worse, as I've stopped working out on regular basis since the last couple months)</p></li>
<li><p>Finish at least 1 indie game title properly</p></li>
<li><p>Spend more/More/MORE/MORE! time with my family 💑</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-summary">Summary of the summary</h2>
<p>So wrapping things up, it wasn't a really bad year. But it also wasn't super-dooper-great one. It was <strong>just</strong> decent.</p>
<p>I wish you, and myself a waaay better one, 2022! Happy New Year! 🎉</p>
