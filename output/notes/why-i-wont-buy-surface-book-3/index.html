  <p>As you might already heard, Microsoft <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/devices/2020/05/06/introducing-surface-go-2-surface-book-3-surface-headphones-2-and-surface-earbuds/">has announced just recently</a> couple new devices &amp; accessories from their Surface family</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of them was <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/surface-book-3/8xbw9g3z71f1?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab">Surface Book 3</a></p>
<p>My first thought was: <em>WHAAAAAA</em> üò≤ ??? But then my emotions subsided.</p>
<p>I'm a happy owner of 2nd generation of Surface Book device. Like, a very, very happy owner - every time I see, use, work with this machine I feel great.</p>
<p>I'm in love with its design and overall quality - I think last time I've felt such strong emotions when I've seen Macbook Pro for the very first time - but even it was something like in 2009 (when I was young and hyped) I don't think it was so strong as it is now with Surface Book.</p>
<p>This is literally a modern piece of art.</p>
<h2 id="while-i-still-havent-prepared-a-fine-review-of-it-yet-i-want-to-spoiler-why-im-not-going-to-buy-its-successor">While I still haven't prepared a fine review of it (yet) I want to spoiler why I'm not going to buy its successor.</h2>
<p>Long story short: I don't feel I need any upgrade.</p>
<p>Like many other people, I wasn't aware that Microsoft has already prepared a next generation of Surface Book. Sincerely, I thought that new version will be released a bit later (like next year or so).</p>
<p>I was only hoping for one particular change - the hinge design</p>
<p><img src="/static/surface-book-hinge.gif" alt="img" /><br />

<p>While this is the most beautiful part of the device (and it looks like almost an sci-fi / alien technology, even after 2 year day-to-day usage) it feels to me as it's also its most vulnerable part.</p>
<p>Why so? When you close the device, there's a gap between screen/tablet and keyboad/base/body part. And I've read already some user stories about grabbing their Surface Books too hard and breaking the screen üò±</p>
<p>Fortunately I work <a href="/experience">100% remote</a> and I don't have to move with my Surface Book very often - but even so, every trip with SB2 is like having an egg packaging (maybe I'm exaggerating, but this beauty is pricy as hell).</p>
<p>So this is the detail I miss in 3rd edition of the SB - I thought Microsoft will somehow redesign their hinge mechanism, to make Surface Book flat when closed, but unfortunately not this time.</p>
<p>Besides that, what else should be changed in such high end device?</p>
<p>Personally, I don't see/need/want anything else. In terms of performance - high-end configuration of SB2 is still flawless. I can even admit that it's an overpowered workhorse for my current needs as I mostly just do some webdev-related programming on it (so GPU is on vacation üòéüå¥).</p>
<p>I also rarely play any games on it (PS4 üíõ) (but that might change in the near future once <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151640/Horizon_Zero_Dawn_Complete_Edition/">Horizon: Zero Dawn</a> will be released on PC üòÅ) - so also I've never experienced <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Surface/comments/8roks8/surface_book_2_undervolting_thermals/">undervolting or throttle</a> that many other owners reported.</p>
<p>And last but not least - the price.</p>
<p>It's not a huge surprise, that newest, most powerful Surface Book will keep the price level similar to its predecessors. But for me it just doesn't offer that much compared to version 2 that it would convince me to make an upgrade/switch.</p>
<p>So right now - I'm waiting for first Surface Book 3 reviews (just out of curiosity) and most probably (I hope I won't break mine in the meantime) for 4th generation of Surface Book üòâ.</p>
<p>PS. For any 1st generation owners of Surface Book - do you consider upgrade/switch? If so, why?</p>
