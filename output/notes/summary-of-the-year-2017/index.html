  <p>Year of 2017 will stay in my memory for a very long time - it was most chaotic, crazy and game changing year in my life.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="but-lets-start-from-the-beginning">But let's start from the beginning</h2>
<p>I think the first quarter of the year was the most chaotic - I've decided to look for a new job opportunity and quit my job without having new one. It took couple weeks before I've found a new one.</p>
<h2 id="work-life-imbalance">Work-life imbalance</h2>
<p>Because of the cooperation with new workplace I've lacked totally from work-life balance. Despite the fact I've worked remotely it turned out that I was almost whole day at work and absent for my family. During this time I've learned a lot but it cost me also a lot of nerves. After couple months of overwork and both physical and mental fatigue we've decided to choose work separately and split up.</p>
<h2 id="freelance--future">Freelance &amp; future</h2>
<p>For the most time of my career I was freelancing - no matter if it was my full-time job or just to gain experience / extra money during free time / after work for my employers (every single one of them know about that).</p>
<p>I've decided to take advantage of the fact that I've setup a legal company and started working for small and medium clients as a web developer, while I was searching for my next full-time workplace at the same time.</p>
<p>During this phase I've also started working on my extra, open-sourced projects. It was a great opportunity to polish skills in tools which I've wanted to use in my new full-time job (BTW. this website is created thanks to one of them).</p>
<p>After couple months, hundreds of sent CVs, motivation letters and recruitment processes I've finally found a new employer (which I'll uncover when I officially start in the second half of January).</p>
<p>All I can tell at this moment is that I'm super excited about it :)</p>
<h2 id="personal-growth-stats">Personal growth stats</h2>
<p>During the 2017, I've made 624 open-source code contributions and gained 263 reputation points on StackOverflow (which makes me to have 2132 in total).</p>
<p>Besides that, <strike>I've reset all my tech-related social media accounts and got a new nickname (mrmnmly ;) )</strike>. While my new <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mrmnmly/">instagram</a> followers grow pretty well (47 followers vs ~20 followers on the old one), my <em>>new twitter account with old username<</em> <a href="https://twitter.com/lukaszkups">twitter</a> goes much worse (19 followers currently vs ~225 on the old one).</p>
<p>In the end, I'm aware that I'm the only one responsible for such situation - I'm pretty focused on programming rather than marketing and it's no magic to me, that it will take long time till anyone get interested in my person to follow ;)</p>
<p>Also, none of my real-life friends doesn't know that I've switched my social media accounts to a new ones - but I think separating professional and private online presence is easier to manage.</p>
<p>During the year, I've managed to finish couple projects using Vue.js and React.js professionally. I'm currently working on a open-source project that uses Vue.js for UI and Express.js as a backend.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>I've also learned that finding remote work is really, really hard. Like almost impossible. But I was not giving up and found one (twice!). But this is the topic for separate article (will publish it soon btw.).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the end, I've learned tons of stuff during last year.</p>
<p>Darn, let's make 2018 better - waay better! :)</p>
<p>All the best for the New Year everyone!</p>
